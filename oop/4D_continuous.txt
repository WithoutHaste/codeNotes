##Continuous

#Continuous Integration

Developers continuously merge they commits into the main branch, so that merge conflicts appear quickly and at smaller sizes than if you wait a while to do this.

Ideally, every developer does a fresh merge from main to their branch, resolves conflicts, then merges up to main.

#Continuous Delivery

Continuous Integration PLUS automated testing that runs when the main branch is updated PLUS an one-button push to production process.

Your product is always ready to push to production, whenever you need it.

#Continuous Deployment

Continuous Delivery BUT if all automated test pass THEN every update to main is automatically pushed to production.
