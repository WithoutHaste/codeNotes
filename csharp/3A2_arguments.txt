##Arguments

Arguments are passed into a method when it is invoked. They are the other side of parameters.

#Named Arguments

You can name a specific argument to:
1) specify an argument out of order
2) improve legibility of the caller, like "what does that bool mean?"

<code>
public void MyMethod(int a, int b = 0, int c = 1)
{
}

MyMethod(5, c: 6);
</code>
Named arguments must come after all unnamed arguments.

(.Net 7.2)

You can now use named arguments before unnamed arguments, provided they are in their correct position.
