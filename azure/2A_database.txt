##Database

#Create

To create a SQL database hosted on Azure:

(as of Sept. 2019)
1) Open your Azure console
2) Click Create a Resource > SQL databases > Create SQL Database
3) Fill in the form
- During this, you have the option of loading the database from an Azure backup file
4) Create
5) Wait for the backend processes to set up your database

#Firewall Access

By default, an Azure database is not available publicly.

To edit Azure Server Firewall rules
- go to Azure Portal > go to the database > Set Server Firewall
- OR open SSMS > try to connect to the Azure database > in the New Firewall Rule popup, log into Azure > use the popup to setup the Firewall rule

It is recommended to only allow administrators this access

To set database-specific firewall rules, you must first enable the server-level firewall access and then use T-SQL to setup the database rules.

#Add User

Log into the Azure database with SSMS.

<code lang="sql">
-- must be in master database to make the LOGIN
CREATE LOGIN test 
WITH PASSWORD = 'SuperSecret!' 

-- must be in your database to create the USER
CREATE USER [test] 
FOR LOGIN [test] 
WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA = dbo; 
  
-- must be in your database to alter ROLES for USER
ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER [test]; 
ALTER ROLE db_datawriter ADD MEMBER [test];

--grant execute permission for specific stored procedures
GRANT EXEC ON dbo.OBJECT_NAME TO [test];
