##List{T}

x64 Platform: generic list size limited to 2GB
Limit can be overridden with <gcAllowVeryLargeObjects enabled="true" />

Lists use a doubling algorithm: if they need more space, the double of their current space will be allocated to them. You can specify how much space they start with when you initialize the list.
