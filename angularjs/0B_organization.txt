##Naming Conventions

kebab-case for custom html attributes
camelCase for the corresponding directives which implement them

x.spec.js contains tests for x.js.

x.component.js contains the component x.
x.component.spec.js contains the tests for component x.

The $ prefix is reserved for angular-provided services.
The $$ prefix is reserved for private-do-not-touch angular properties.

##Organization

The test (spec) file resides with the file it tests.

One feature per file, be it a component, a controller, or a template.

All files for a component reside in a folder with the component's name.

Ex:
<code>
app/
	app.js
	phone-list/
		phone-list.component.js
		phone-list.component.spec.js
	shared/
</code>

The shared folder can be called 'shared', 'common', or 'core'.
