##How it works

1) A client machine makes a request to a server.

The request is a text document containing a Verb, Headers, and Content.
ex: POST, Content Length: 11, Hello World

2) The server processes the request and may return a response.

The response is a text document containing a Status Code, Headers, and Content.
ex: 201, Content Type: text, Hello World

The server is stateless. It process each request individually.
