##Layouts

Layout components can be added to GameObjects.

#Vertical Layout / Horizontal Layout

Child Controls Size:
Looks like there's general agreement that this was poorly named, and maybe "control child's size" would have been better.
If it is checked, that dimension of the children will be set by this layout.

#Grid Layout

Cell size must be specified exactly. The only way I've seen to auto-resize the cells to fit their container is through scripts.

Consider using nested Vertical Layout and Horizontal Layouts instead, which do support auto-resizing.

Script to auto-resize grid:
<code>
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public AutoSizeGrid : MonoBehavior
{
	public int RowCount;
	public int ColCount;

	public void Start()
	{
		RectTransform container = gameObject.GetComponent<RectTransform>();
		GridLayoutGroup gridLayout = gameObject.GetComponent<GridLayoutGroup>();
		gridLayout.cellSize = new Vector2(container.rect.width / ColCount, container.rect.height / RowCount);
	}
}
</code>
Add this script to the GameObject that has a Grid Layout component.
