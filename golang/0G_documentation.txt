##Documentation

#Basic

Comments on packages and public members are automatically included in the module documentation.

Run "go doc {qualified name}" to test your documentation.

# Comments

Single line
<code>
// comments
// comments
</code>

Multiline
<code>
/*
comments
comments
*/
</code>

#Style

Use complete sentences.
Start the first sentence with the element's name (or an article, then the name).
Write the first sentence as a "short description" of the element.

#Package

You can include documentation throughout your code files.
<code>
// license comments
// license comments
// license comments

// Package {name} {intent}
// doc comments
// doc comments
package foo
</code>

You can also include a "doc.go" to hold all the documentation for a directory/package. Use this for long package comments.
<code>
// license comments
// license comments
// license comments

/*
	Package {name} {intent}
	doc comments
	doc comments
*/
package foo
</code>

#Members

You can add comments/documentation to any member (variable, type, function, method).
