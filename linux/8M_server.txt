# Virtual Hosting

Virtual hosting is hosting multiple domain names from one IP address. Apache's virtual host directs requests to different folders, based on the domain name.

Apache's top-level directory for websites is "/var/www"
Create subdirectories here for each domain name. Include a "public_html" directory nested in each one.

Set the ownership on the "public_html" directory to the user who owns that website.
<code>
sudo chown -R USER:GROUP /var/www/example.com/public_html
</code>

Make sure the new directories are reable by all users. This may already be set correctly.
<code>
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www
</code>

Upload an html file to the public_html directory for testing.

Make a copy of "/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf" for each domain name.
<code>
sudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.com.conf
</code>
Edit the file with this template
<code>
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerAdmin admin@example.com
	ServerName example.com
	ServerAlias www.example.com
	DocumentRoot /var/www/example.com/public_html
	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
	CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
</code>

Enable the virtual hosts
<code>
sudo a2ensite example.com.conf
</code>

Restart Apache for the changes to take effect
<code>
sudo service apache2 restart
</code>

To test this setup, you can hard-code your local computer's host file. (This is not referring to the linux server, but to the computer you will test with.)
- Linux
  - edit "/etc/hosts" to include a line like "111.111.111.111 example.com"
- Windows
  - edit "c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts" to include a line like "111.111.111.111 example.com"
  
# Directory Browsing

Directory browsing is when the web user can view the list of files in a directory on your server.

To disable directory browsing for all sites hosted on the server:
- open "/etc/apache2/apache2.conf"
- change line "Options Indexes FollowSymLinks" to "Options FollowSymLinks"
- restart apache2 service for changes to take effect
