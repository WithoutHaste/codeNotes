##Base

Common properties of NoSQL databases. BASE systems do not guarantee consistency.

Basically Available: the system is guaranteed to be available.

Soft state: the state of the system may change over time even without input (see Eventually Consistent Model).

Eventual consistency: the system will become consistent, provided there is zero input for a while
