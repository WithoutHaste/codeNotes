##CAP Theorem

The CAP theorem for distributed computing, published by Eric Brewer: 

It is not possible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. At most, two of these can be provided at a time.

Consistency: all nodes see the same data at the same time.

Availability: every request receives a FAILED or SUCCEEDED response.

Partition Tolerance: the system continues to operate despite partial system failure or arbitrary message loss.
