##Comm

Comm will compare two files line-by-line.
It outputs (A) the lines just in File 1 (B) the lines just in File 2 (C) the lines in both files.

The files must be pre-sorted.

If the comparison seems to not be working, check how lines are ended. Line-Feed vs Carriage-Return-Line-Feed, for instance.

#Options

-1 to suppress column 1 (lines unique to File 1)
-2 to suppress column 2 (lines unique to File 2)
-3 to suppress column 3 (lines shared by both files)

Getting the lines that only appear in File 1
<code>
comm -23 File1 File2
</code>

--check-order will check that the files are sorted
--nocheck-order will not check that the files are sorted

--output-delimiter=X sets the column delimiter
