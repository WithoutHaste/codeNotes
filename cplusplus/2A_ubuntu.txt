## Ubuntu: Getting Started

from [stackexchange](https://askubuntu.com/questions/36520/how-could-i-begin-c-programming-on-ubuntu)

Ubuntu comes with gcc

example hello world:
save as "helloworld.c" for "c"
save as "helloworld.cpp" for "c++"
<code>
 #include <stdio.h>

int main ()
{
	printf("Hello World");
}
</code>

to compile:
<code>
gcc helloworld.c -o helloworld

g++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld
</code>
"-o" is followed by the output file name (the executable file)
(my ubuntu said it did not have "g++" auto-installed, but could install it with "sudo apt install g++")

to execute:
<code>
./helloworld
</code>
