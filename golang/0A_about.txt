# History

Developed by engineers at Google

Aimed to:
- compile fast
- compile fully to machine code, so it will run fast
- be strongly typed
- be concurrent by default (built-in thread management)
- use garbage collection (aimed to pause as little as possible)
- be simple (syntax, maintencance, etc)

Designed to be good at:
- general purpose, many applications
- web services (deliver data)
- web applications (deliver webpages)

Turned out to also be good for:
- task automation (syntax as light as some scripting languages)
- machine learning (syntax light enough to compete with python)
