##Naming Conventions

#Case

All names are in CamelCase.

Constants and Readonlys have names in all capitals with snake case, such as MAX_COUNT.

Property names start with a capital letter.
Public field names start with a capital letter.
Private field names start with a lower case letter.

Method names start with a capital letter.

#Name

Classes have singular names, such as "Customer" instead of "Customers".

Interface names start with "I", such as "IEnumerable".

Fields that are private even within the object start with an underscore, such as _extraPrivateField.
- This indicates that even within the object, this field should not be touched lightly.
- It may indicate a readonly field.

Boolean properties and fields start with "Is" or "Has", such as "IsActive" or "HasErrors".
Methods that return booleans are named the same way.

Class names should not be the same as their Namespace's name.
It confuses the compiler in some cases about which thing you are referring to.
It requires you to fully-qualify class names all over your code.
- What to call the Namespace, then?
- maybe pluralize the name
- maybe specify the use of the Namespace more abstractly
- maybe don't separate this Namespace out at all

#Acronyms

Acronyms are spelled with only their first character capitalized, such as "Xml" or "Tcp".

#Verbose Names

It's ok to have long variable/method/class names. For instance, I recommend saying "synchronizationContext" instead of "syncContext" or worse "syncCnt".

The name might be very long, such as "CheckInRemoteCustomerWithoutSynchronizationUsingDurableLayer".
And maybe some of that information can be refactored into parameter types or the class name.
But if it can't, you need it to be in the field or method name.
Don't leave information out just because the name is long.

Verbose names are easier to read and to understand.
Verbose names are part of self-documenting code.

You only have to write it a few times, but you'll have to read it many many times.

#Keyword Override

to use a keyword as a variable name, add a "@" at the beginning
<code>
var @using = "i really wanted this keyword as a variable name";
return @using;
</code>
<code>
for(var @case in cases) { }
</code>
