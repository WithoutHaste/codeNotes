Game Maker Studio 2

Tabs:
Each workspace gets its own tab. You can drag tabs out to be their own window, and drag them back in to be tabs.

Navigate workspace chains:
Ctrl + Alt + ArrowKey: to move left/right along a chain. The selected subwindow is centered in your view.

Bookmarks:
Ctrl + Shift + NumberKey[1-9]: sets a bookmark on the window or line of code.
Ctrl + NumberKey[1-9]: Go to the selected bookmark.

Bookmarks only last for the current session; they are not saved on the project.
