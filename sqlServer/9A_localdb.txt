##LocalDb

Microsoft SQL Server 2012 LocalDb
Microsoft SQL Server 2014 LocalDb
Microsoft SQL Server 2016 LocalDb
Microsoft SQL Server Express LocalDb

These are light-weight databases for developers. Instead of running as a Service, they are run on-demand (when a connection is attempted) and turn off when the last connection closes.

The actual data is saved in the user's Application Install folder.

Run the SqlLocalDb Utility to verify installation:
<code>
//in command prompt
SQLLocalDb info
</code>
If installed, it will output "MSSQLLocalDb" and (sometimes) the version number.

#Connection

To make a connection from Visual Studio:
1) Open your Visual Studio ASP.Net project
2) View menu > Database Explorer (or Server Explorer, in other versions of Visual Studio)
3) Right-click on Data Connections > Add Connection
4) Select Microsoft SQL Server > Continue
5) Set Server Name to connect to SQL Server Local DB 
 - in Visual Studio 2012, use "(LocalDb)\v11.0"
 - in Visual Studio 2015/2017, use "(LocalDb)\MSSQLLocalDB"
6) Select an existing database from the list, or enter a new name
7) Ok

Now in the Database Explorer, you can see the structure of that database.

You can right-click on a table in the Database Explorer > Show Table Data
- view data
- edit data manually
- insert data manually

You can look at the Properties for the connection to see the connectionstring:
Ex: "Data Source=(LocalDb)\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=DemoDatabase;Integrated Security=True"

#Delete Database

You can access LocalDb database through Visual Studio:
View menu > SQL Server Object Explorer
- open the LocalDb Databases folder
- you can delete a database from here
