##Debugging

#Break Points

To debug Unity scripts with Visual Studio (Windows):
1. In Visual Studio > Tools menu > Extensions and Updates > install the Visual Studios Tools For Unity plug-in.
2. In Unity, Edit menu > Preferences > External Tools tab > check Editor Attaching.
3. Set a breakpoint in the code open in Visual Studio.
4. In Visual Studio, click "Attach to Unity" along the top.
5. In Unity, click Play.

If you have Visual Studio 2017, this should work without error.

If you have Visual Studio 2015:
1. When you click "Attach to Unity", you'll get a popup about errors in the build, do you want to use the latest build?
2. Click "Yes"
3. You see this error in the errors console:
  * Invalid option 'latest' for /langversion; must be ISO-1, ISO-2, Default or an integer in range 1 to 6.
4. Ignore the error and click "Play" in Unity. Debugging will work.

#Windowed vs Full Screen

There does not seem to be any way to test windowed vs full screen functionality when running a normal "Play" test inside the Unity IDE.

Seems you must build the project fully and run it as its own application.
In Unity: File menu > Build and Run > select folder to save build to > Ok

Note the build will be starting with a fresh set of PlayerPrefs.

#Log Files

Everything sent to Debug.Log is automatically saved to log file "Editor.log".

macOS:   ~/Library/Logs/Unity/Editor.log
Windows: C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Unity\Editor\Editor.log
