##Windowed

Unity starts the application by asking the user to select what size window they want to use.
- can I turn that off?

<code>
Resolution x = Screen.CurrentResolution; //get resolution of window
Resolution[] y = Screen.resolutions; //list of resolutions supported by the monitor, smallest to largest (may not include all options)
</code>

Is application full screen?
<code>
bool isFullScreen = Screen.fullScreen;
</code>
You can also set this value to change it.

Set window size manually:
<code>
Screen.SetResolution(width, height, boolFullScreen);
Screen.SetResolution(width, height, FullScreenMode);
//preferredRefreshRate is an optional parameter
</code>
FullScreenMode:
- ExclusiveFullScreen: Unity will change the monitor's resolution and claim control of it.
- FullScreenWindow: A normal full screen window, at the monitor's resolution. OS UI can display over the window.
- MaximizedWindow: A normal window that is windowed but sized to fill the screen.
- Windowed: A normal window that is windowed and sized smaller than the screen.
