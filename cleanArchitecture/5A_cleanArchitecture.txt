##Clean Architecture

#Basic

Solid arrows = source code dependency
Dashed arrows = flow of control
<pinker>
Layout:
	[UI][Business Rules][Database]
Relate:
	[UI]->[Business Rules]
	[Database]->[Business Rules]
	[Business Rules]=>[UI],[Database]
</pinker>

The UI and the Database become plug-ins to the Business Rules. They can be compiled into separate components (such as C# assemblies) and deployed independently of each other.

Independent Deployability: only the component that was edited needs to be re-compiled and re-deployed.

Independent Developability: if components can be deployed independently, then they can be developed independently by different teams.
