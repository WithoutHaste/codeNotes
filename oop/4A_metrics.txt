##Cyclomatic Complexity

A software metric related to the complexity of the program.  A measure of the linearly independent paths through a program's source code.

Ex: A to B to C to D
	Cyclomatic Complexity equals 1 because there is only 1 path

Ex: A to B to D
	A to C to D
	Cyclomatic complexity equals 2 because there are 2 paths
	
Generally, in a control flow graph, complexity = edges - nodes + 2*loops
(loops are called Connected Components)
