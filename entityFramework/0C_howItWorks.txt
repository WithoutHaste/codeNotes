##How EF Works

#Summary

Create your Domain classes.

DbContext API wraps the Domain classes. Instruct EF how this model maps to the database schema.
You may create many different DbContexts from one database.

Write your queries using LINQ To Entities, against your domain classes. EF will translate the queries into SQL queries against the database schema.

Can map to database tables or to database views.
Can execute stored procedures.

#Models

EDMX Model vs Code-Based Model

EF can use a visual model (the drag-n-drop designer) or a model inferred from your domain classes.

If you use the designer, it will generate a *.edmx file (xml format). Then it will generate domain classes based on the *.edmx.
(EDMX = Entity Data Model XML)
If you write your own domain classes, those steps are skipped.

At runtime, any available *.edmx file will be used by default. Your custom domain classes will only be used if there is no *.edmx file (Code-First API generates the in-memory model).
Either way, EF generates an in-memory model.
