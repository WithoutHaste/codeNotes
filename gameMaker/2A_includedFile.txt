##Included File

You can include miscellaneous files with the final game.  Locally, the files are stored in *.gmx/data-files.

Included files can be organized into a folder structure.

Included files can be marked included/excluded for various game platforms.

#Platform

Right-click on an included file and select "Properties" or "Edit" to set which platforms this file will be included with. The default seems to be "All".

#Read Text

Filename is relative to the Included Files tree root.
<code>
var fileId = file_text_open_read(working_directory + "\" + filename);

while(!file_text_eof(fileId))
{
	var line = file_text_readln(fileId);
}

file_text_close(fileId);
</code>
