##Include

#Include

Include other php or text files in the current script.
<code>
include "otherFile.php";
</code>
The path to the otherFile can be absolute, based on the "include_path", or relative based on the current script's directory.

The contents of included files can be considered to be copied directly into that line in the current script. That's true even if the "include" is inside a function definition.

#Require

Require is just like Include, except if the file is not found you'll get a fatal error.
