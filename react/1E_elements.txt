##Elements

React elements are returned by "React.createElement" statements.

React elements are plain Javascript objects.

React DOM handles keeping the HTML DOM up to date with the React elements.

<code>
const element = (
	<h1 className="greeting">
		Hello, world!
	</h1>
);
//becomes
const element = React.createElement(
	'h1',
	{className: 'greeting'},
	'Hello, world!'
);
//becomes something like
const element = {
	type: 'h1',
	props: {
		className: 'greeting',
		children: 'Hello, world!'
	}
};
</code>

#Immutable

React elements are immutable.

For each change to the DOM, you'll need to create a new React element and render it.

This update process is greatly simplified by using React components.
