#Cannot delete branch

Scenario:
In Git browser, I cannot click the delete "trashcan" on a branch because "a pull request depends on it".
No pull request depends on it.

Fix:
I can delete the branch through Git Desktop.

Follow Up:
It turns out there was a PR into that branch which I was unaware of. Deleting the branch automatically closed the PR.
It still stands that I was able to force the delete through Git Desktop.
