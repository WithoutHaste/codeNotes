##Sprites

Sprites are an Asset type.
Sprites are 2D textures.

Add sprites to your project by simply copying them into the Asset folder (or a subdirectory of it).

Or right-clicking in the Project Detail pane > Import New Asset.
If the project is in 2D mode, all images are automatically imported as sprites.

Edit menu > Project Settings > Graphics > Transparency Sort Mode
This will determine which sprites are rendered on top of each other. For 2D games, this is commonly based on the y-coordinate.

#Sprite Atlas

An atlas is one image that contains multiple sprite images, separated by transparent space. The atlas will be unpacked into its individual pieces.

Unity has a utility to automatically pack these images together as efficiently as possible.

Asset menu > Create > Sprite Atlas
This will create a *.spriteatlas file.

This seems to be intended for (example) a character made up of many different sprites, all with unusual shapes.

#9-Slicing

How to set a background on a button/menu/etc that will resize smartly, without strange distortion.

1. Make your basic button sprite
2. Import the sprite
3. Select sprite > Inspector pane
- set "Mesh Type" to "Full Rectangle"
4. Click "Sprite Editor" > Resize the border lines that start at the edges of the image
- drag-n-drop the green border lines, or specify the L/R/T/B values (measurements are inward from each edge)
- this will divide the image into 9 regions
- when the image is resized, the corners will not be changed, only the other 5 sections will be stretched
- you'll only see this in effect on UI objects
5. Click "Apply" to save changes
6. Set the sprite as the Image on a button
- set "Image Type" to "Sliced" OR set "Draw Mode" to "Sliced"

You can also set "Draw Mode" to "Tiled", which will cause the 5 center segments of the sprite to be tiled instead of stretched.

#File Formats

Supported formats: bmp, exr, gif, hdr, iff, jpg, pict, png, psd, tga, tiff

As of version 2018.2, Unity supports *.svg

Window menu > Package Manager > All button > select Vector Graphics > Install button

Now you can drag-n-drop *.svg files into the Project pane, or right-click > Import New Asset.

Update: I can't find anyone saying Vector Graphics is not available to Unity Personal, but I also can't find it to install in Package Manager.
