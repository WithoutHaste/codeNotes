##Non-Transact

Commands which are not Transact-SQL.
They are only recognized by the sqlcmd and osql utilities, and SSMS code editor.

#GO

GO signals the end of a batch of Transact-SQL. Execution will not continue until the previous batch is complete.

Note that local variable scope is limited to the current batch, so they cannot be referenced after a GO command.

<code>
some sql;
GO
some sql;
</code>
Note that GO is not followed by a semicolon.

You can add a count to GO, which will cause the previous batch to run that many times before execution continues.
<code>
GO 5
</code>
