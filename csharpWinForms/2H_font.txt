##Fonts

Setting a Label and a TextBox to the same font can result in different looking fonts.
1) Label seems to round floating point font sizes up to a whole number, while TextBox seems to round them down.
2) Even with whole-number font sizes, I'm struggling with obvious differences in the rendered text. Labels are displaying at 4 points larger than expected.

Measuring expected text size with Graphics vs TextRenderer can give drastically different results.
<code>
using(Graphics graphics = this.CreateGraphics())
{
	SizeF size = graphics.MeasureString(text, font);
}
//versus
Size size = TextRenderer.MeasureText(text, font);
</code>
TextRenderer uses GDI, but Graphics uses GDI+. So if the text will be drawn with Graphics.DrawString, use the Graphics measurement. If it will be drawn with TextRenderer.DrawText then use the TextRenderer measure.

Now, Label control property UseCompatibleTextRendering defaults to False.
If True, the Label will use Graphics to draw text.
If False, the Label will use TextRenderer to draw text.
TextArea is definitely using Graphics to render text (tested), so setting the Label property to True should make the Label and TextArea render the same Font the same way.
However, neither property value fixes the problem with Labels displaying Font larger than TextArea does.
