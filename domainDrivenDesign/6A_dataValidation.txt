## Data Validation

Aggregates have the responsibility of ensuring their internal state is always valid. Therefore, data validation must be handled in the Domain. (It may also be handled at higher levels, but it must occur at this lowest level.)

!![Microsoft: Domain model layer validations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/domain-model-layer-validations)

"Validations are usually implemented in domain entity constructors or in methods that can update the entity."

How to implement validations?
1) raise an Exception if an error is found
2) use the Specification Pattern to return true/false for IsValid
3) use the Notification Pattern to return a list of all errors found
