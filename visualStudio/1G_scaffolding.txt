##Scaffolding

Scaffolding will quickly fill in basic code structures.

#Implement Interface

Your class will implement an interface. You don't want to type in all those method signatures yourself.

1) Add the interface to the inheritance of the class
<code>
public class MyClass : ISomeInterface
{
}
</code>

2) Right-click on the interface > Quick Actions and Refactorings > Implement Interface

You'll see all the method signatures filled in with NotImplementedException statements.
