##Comparable

Interface IComparable is required for LINQ comparisons.

<code>
public MyClass : IComparable
{
	public int CompareTo(object other)
	{
		if(!(other is MyClass))
			return -1; //return whatever makes the most sense
		if(this < (other as MyClass))
			return -1;
		if(this == (other as MyClass))
			return 0;
		return 1;
	}
}
</code>
