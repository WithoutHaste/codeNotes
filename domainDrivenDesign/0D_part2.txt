#Preface: The Building Blocks of Model Driven Design

"Certain kinds of decisions keep the model and implementation aligned with each other, each reinforcing the other's effectiveness. This alignment requires attention to the details of individual elements."

"The design style in this book largely follows the principle of Responsibilty Driven Design...and Design By Contract."

"Elaborate models can cut through complexity only if care is taken with the fundementals, rsulting in detailed elements that the team can confidently combine."
