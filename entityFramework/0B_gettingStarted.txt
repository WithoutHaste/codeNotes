##Getting Started

#Schema-First

Schema-First approach means opening a graphical designer in Visual Studio, pointing it at an existing database schema, and having it auto-import that schema information.

If you reverse-engineer to an EDMX, the file can be automatically updated when the database changes.

If you reverse-engineer to Domain classes, they cannot be automatically updated.

#Model-First

Model-First approach means opening a graphical designer in Visual Studio, and drawing a diagram of the object model you'll be using.

If you generate the database schema from this model, the database cannot be automatically updated with changes later.

#Code-First

Code-First approach means writing your C# classes, and having those auto-imported into the object model.

Can auto-generate database schema from Domain classes.
Can auto-update database schema when the Domain classes change (Migration).

EF starts with a set of conventions to infer what the database schema should be.
EF also supports may ways to specify non-conventional mappings.
