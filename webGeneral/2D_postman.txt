##Postman

Desktop tool for creating API requests - useful for testing APIs.

#Workspace

A Workspace can store multiple Collections.
A Workspace can be accessed/shared by multiple users.

Changes saved to a shared Workspace will appear in other users' Workspaces very quickly, and automatically.

To switch with Workspace you are using:
- click Workspace drop down at middle-top of screen
- select Personal or Team Workspaces
- select you Workspace

To add users to a Workspace:
- switch to the Workspace
- click "Invite" at middle-top of screen
- invite users

#Collection

A Collection is an ordered grouping of API calls.

To give users more access to a Collection:
- switch to the Workspace
- hover over the Collection in the left-hand bar > click "..." > click "Manage Roles"
- you can give/remove user access here

#Test Suites

Create a Collection of the APIs you want to call, in order.

To connect the output of one request to the input of another:
- Add a Test Script to the first request
<code lang="javascript">
var jsonData = JSON.parse(responseBody);
postman.setEnvironmentVariable("nextInput", jsonData.my_field);
</code>
- Update the Body of the second request to accept a Postman Environment Variables
<code lang="javascript">
{
	"my_field": "{{nextInput}}"
}
</code>

Click "Runner" (top-left) > select Colletion > select options > click "Run".
