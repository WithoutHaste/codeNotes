##Fault Contracts

Defines errors raised by the service, ie. tells the client what kinds of faults to expect from an operation.

By default, services use Error Masking: all exceptions are passed to the client as generic FaultExceptions.

<code>
using System.ServiceModel;

//in service contract
[OperationContract]
[FaultContract(typeof(MathFault))]
int Divide(int a, int b);

//does NOT inherit from Exception
[DataContract]
public class MathFault
{
	public string Message { get; set; }
}

//in service
int Divide(int a, int b)
{
	try
	{
		return a / b;
	}
	catch(DivideByZeroException)
	{
		throw new FaultException<MathFault>(new MathFault());
	}
}
</code>
Note that MathFault does not inherit from System.Exception - it justs contains the Properties it needs.
