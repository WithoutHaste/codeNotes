"The crystal methodology is one of the most adaptable, light-weight approaches to software development."

It's actually a collection of methodologies like Crystal Clear, Crystal Yellow, and Crystal Orange. The choice of methodology is based on team size, how critical the project is, and project priorities.

The aim is to provide tailored processes suitable for each team and project.
