##Sound

For background music and sound effects.

Accepts Wave (.wav) and MP3 files. 

Sounds can be assigned to audio groups, that can be loaded/unloaded in memory all at once and can use the same volume controls.

#Wave

Wave files are usually used for sound effects because the format allows the sound to be played instantly.

You can also play multiple wave files simultaneously.

#MP3

Use MP3 format for background music.  GameMaker only allows you to play one at a time.

#Play

Play a sound resource once.  This will only work if your IDE is set to use the old audio engine.
<code>
sound_play(name_of_sound);
</code>

Play any sound resource, possibly in a loop.  This will only work if your IDE is set to use the new audio engine.
<code>
audio_play_sound(name_of_sound, priority, loopSound);
</code>
Lower (lesser) priority sounds may be canceled if too many sounds are playing at once.  Priorities are arbitrary integers.

Set sound volume, for all future times the sound is played.
0 = silent, 1 = full volume
<code>
sound_volume(name_of_sound, volume);
</code>
Sound volume is logarithmic, so ~0.8 is half the volume of 1.

You can also set the default volume per sound in the sound's properties. The properties volume slider appears to be linear rather than logarithmic.

To stop a sound:
<code>
audio_stop_sound(name_of_sound);
</code>
