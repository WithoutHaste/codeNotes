##Authentication

Authentication is the act of determining what user is using the system.

#Windows

The client will create a Windows token and pass it to the service.
The Windows token will be based on the how the current user is logged into Windows.
- If the client is a desktop application, then the Windows identity will be the user logged into that machine.
- If the client is an internet web application, then the Windows identity will be whatever IIS is running as on that machine.

You can also send a non-default Windows identity through the proxy.

#Alternate Credentials

You can send non-default credentials/identity to the client proxy.
<code>
public void ClientOperation()
{
	GeographyClient proxy = new GeographyClient();
	
	//this must still be a valid Windows user on the current machine
	proxy.ClientCredentials.Windows.ClientCredentials.UserName = "otherUser";
	proxy.ClientCredentials.Windows.ClientCredentials.Domain = "otherDomain"; //optional
	proxy.ClientCredentials.Windows.ClientCredentials.Password = "password";
	
	var result = proxy.MyOperation();

	proxy.Close();
}
</code>
