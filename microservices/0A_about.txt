##About

Microservices is a distributed systems architecture.
- Use of small, autonomous services
- Services collaborate to complete use cases
- Microservices are primarily modeled around business domains
- Microservices have independent life-cycles

Supports principles:
- The fundamental design of a system should make it easy to change

#Strengths

Of a distributed system:
- Gives development teams increased autonomy
- Different parts of the system can be scaled independently
- Easy to build a resilient system, such that one one server/service going down does not bring down the entire system
- Composability of services

Of microservices, specifically:
- Each service can use the technology most appropriate to it (Technology Heterogeneity)
- Lower risk when trying out new technologies - You can apply it to one service at a time
- Lower risk deployments - one service instead of the entire system (supports good Continuous Deployment practices)
- Strong code boundaries can align with team boundaries
