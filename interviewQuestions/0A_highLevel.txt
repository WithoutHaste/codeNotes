##In General

All questions are a starting point. Don't get stuck on the exact wording of the question.

You don't always have to answer the exact question they asked, as long as you are still near the topic.

If you don't have a personal experience to match a question, talk about how you would handle the situation if it comes up. The real question is "do you know how to behave in such and such situation?"
