##Cursor

Set global variable cursor_sprite to any loaded sprite index.
The default cursor is -1;

The sprite image_index and image_speed cannot be set.

<code>
cursor_sprite = spr_myCursor;
</code>

##Mouse

Set game to register a left-double-click as a single-right-click. 

If user is on a Mac, their computer settings may override this and (for example) set a two-finger-left-click as a single-right-click. If so, it will register correctly in the game.

<code>
device_mouse_dbclick_enable(true);
</code>
