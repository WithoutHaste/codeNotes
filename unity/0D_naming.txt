##Naming Conventions

I couldn't find anything online about agreed standards for naming objects/assets/etc in Unity projects.

Here are my arbitrary guidelines.

"Scene<name>"
- Each scene name has "Scene" prefix.
- Use the same name that you use for this scene (menu/level/room/etc) in your documentation/notes.

"SceneController"
- An empty GameObject at the root level of a scene hierarchy. 
- Contains the controller script for that scene ("Controller<name>").
- Maximum 1 per scene.

"Controller<name>"
- A script that contains all the global controller code for a single scene.
- Each controller script has "Controller" prefix.
- Use the same name as the scene.
- All scene controller scripts are in the custom "Assets/Controllers" folder.

Assets:
- There shouldn't be any files floating at the root level of the "Assets" folder. (Except for technical things like "link.xml")

Assets/Resources:
- Camel case names, such as "configPlayers.txt".
- Start name with the category/purpose of the file, followed by the specifics.
- Assets/Resources/Prefabs: prefabs that can be found and loaded from Scripts

Assets/Scripts:
- Custom folder to contain all scripts.
- Assets/Scripts/Controllers: for all controllers
- Assets/Scripts/Global: for Singletons and ScriptableObjects - anything global that does not need to be attached to GameObjects
- Assets/Scripts/Utilities: for small, reusable behaviors

Assets/Sprites:
- Custom folder to contain all sprites.
