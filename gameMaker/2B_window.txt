##Window

#Window

The window is the application window.

<code>
window_set_fullscreen(bool);
</code>
"true" will expand window to full screen.
"false" will shrink window to its previous non-full-screen size.

<code>
window_set_size(width, height);
</code>
Window contents will be automatically scaled to fit a 1:1 ratio to the background image.  It works better to change the window size programmatically than to let the user manually change it.

<code>
var width = window_get_width();
var height = window_get_height();
</code>

#Display

The display seems to be the entire screen.

<code>
var width = display_get_width();
var height = display_get_height();
</code>

#Settings

In Global Game Settings > Windows > Graphics, you can set the options "Allow the player to resize the game window" and "Allow switching to fullscreen".

To allow full screen size in Mac, the default Game Setting must be "start in full screen mode".
