##Terminology

#CLI

CLI stands for Command Line Interface.
This program can be run from the command line.

#Web Hook

An API or web service that a 3rd party service calls asynchronously. Used to implement event reactions.
aka Web Callback aka HTTP Push API aka Reverse API
A way for a service to provide other apps with real-time information; Web Hooks deliver data as it happens.

Web Hooks will usually POST to your app.

1) give the Web Hook provider a url to deliver requests to (must be publicly accessible)
2) data will usually be POSTED as JSON (or maybe XMl or form data)

Can be tricky to debug as you usually trigger an event and then wait for the asynchronous response.
Postman is a useful tool for spoofing Web Hooks requests.
