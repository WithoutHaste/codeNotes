##About

MongoDb is a document database (i.e. a no SQL database).

It is advertised as cross-platform, providing high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.

#Schemaless

MongoDb is a schemaless database. Every document can be a different structure, if you want.

#Relationships

MongoDb does not support relationships between Collections or Documents.
If you want data to be used together, save it as one document.

Instead of relying on foreign keys, just duplicate the data whereever it is needed.
MongoDb says disk space is cheap.
