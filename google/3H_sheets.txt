##Google Sheets

#Terminology

"Sheet" I think refers to both a single Google Sheet document (can contain multiple tabs) and a single tab in a document.

#Reference another sheet

(Where "Sheet" means another tab in the same document)

Set this cell to the value of "Sheet1" cell "A1"
<code>
=Sheet1!A1
</code>

Refer to a sheet that has spaces in the name
<code>
='Name Name'!A1
</code>

#Unique

<code>
=unique({Sheet1!B2:B900;D3:D900})
</code>
Get all the unique values from param1 range, display them in param2 range.

#Lookup

<code>
=ArrayFormula(iferror(vlookup(D2:D900,'From AAT Mongo B'!A2:C900,3,0),0))
</code>

VLOOKUP
- First param: the keys to search for.
- Second param: the range to search through. The first column in this range will be searched for the key from First Param.
- Third param: the index in the Second Param range that holds the value you want to display. The index starts at 1 for the first column in the Second Param range.
- Fourth param: TRUE or 1 if the first column of Second Param range is sorted.

#Matches

Check that two values match
<code>
=A2=B2
</code>

Display "" for a match and "ERROR" for not a match.
<code>
=IF(A2=B2,"","ERROR")
</code>

#Logical Expressions

<code>
AND(a,b,c)
IF(AND(A2=B2,A2<>C2))
</code>

#Table Join

Note: I haven't actually gotten this working yet

The range of data making up each table must have the same number of columns in each.
- You get error "array literal was missing values for one or more rows" if the number of columns does not match.

<code>
=QUERY({'From DE/Insurity'!A2:B;'From AAT Mongo B'!A1:C},"Select INS_A_NAME, INS_P_CODE, EXT_A_NAME, MONGO_P_CODE, MONGO_A_ID where INS_P_CODE = MONGO_P_CODE and INS_A_NAME <> EXT_A_NAME",1)
</code>
- First param is the range of data for each table.  Just provide the first cell with a column header and the final column letter.
- Second param is the query. Use the same column headers as the tables have.
- Third param, I'm not sure what it is.
