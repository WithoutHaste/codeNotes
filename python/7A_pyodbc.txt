##PyODBC

Microsoft's recommended python library for accessing SQL Server.

#Install

<code lang="bash">
pip install pyodbc
</code>
(Might need to run this at C:\Users\<YOUR NAME>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python<VERSION>\Scripts)

#Connect to Database

Using current user's Windows login:
<code>
import pyodbc 

connStr = (
    r"DRIVER={SQL Server Native Client 11.0};"
    r"SERVER=(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB;"
	r"Database=MyDatabase;"
	r"Trusted_Connection=yes;")
print(connStr)
conn = pyodbc.connect(connStr, autocommit=True)

cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('SELECT ColumnA, ColumnB FROM dbo.myTable')

for row in cursor: #row is a Tuple
    print(row)
</code>

Errors:
- I got a login error when actually I had a typo in the database name.
