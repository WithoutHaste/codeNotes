##What is Architecture

Grady Booch:
Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system, where significant is measured by cost of change.

Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder:
If you think good architecture is expensive, try bad architecture.

Ralph Johnson:
Architecture is the decisions that you wish you could get right early in a project, but that you are not necessarily more likely to get them right than any other.

Tom Glib:
Architecture is a hypothesis that needs to be proven by implementation and measurement.

The only way to go fast, is to go well.

When you get software right, something magical happens: You don't need hordes of programmers to keep it working. You don't need massive requirements documents and huge issue tracking systems. You don't need global cube farms and 24/7 programming.

When software is done right, it requires a fraction of the human resources to create and maintain. Changes are simple and rapid. Defects are few and far between. Effort is minimized, and functionality and flexibility are maximized.

The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system.
