##API Design

Design your API before you start coding it.

Once you publish an API, you'll have clients building their code on top of yours.
The cost of altering your API goes up quickly, the more people rely on it.

#Parts of the API

Request = Verb + URI (with Query String) + Headers + Content

Response = Status Code + Headers + Content

#URI

A URI is a path to a resource on your server.
Ex: api.myserver.com/people is a path to the "people" resources.

Your URIs should be Nouns. Ex: Repositories, Customers, Contracts, Books.
Leave the Verbs to the HTTP Request Verbs.

#Query String

Query strings should always be optional.

They are commonly used for Formatting, Sorting, Searching, etc.
