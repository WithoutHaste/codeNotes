##Unix

making a Ruby file an executable
- make the *.rb file executable (chmod +x my_file.rb)
- include the shebang line in the file
<code>
 #!/usr/bin/ruby
 
 puts 'hello world'
</code>
now you can run the file without saying "ruby" first
<code>
./my_file.rb
</code>

"shebang" refers to the "sharp-bang" symbols (#!) that start the line
this tells unix what program to use to run the file
