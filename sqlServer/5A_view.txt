##Views

A view is a virtual table based on the results of a SQL statement.
The data is updated every time the view is queried.

When are views useful?
- They abstract away complex computations.
- You can give users access to a View without them access to the underlying tables.

#Naming Convention

Views are named "vw_ViewName", or something similar.

#Create

<code>
CREATE VIEW viewName AS
	SELECT 
		columnA, 
		columnB 
	FROM tableName 
	WHERE columnC <> value;
</code>

#Update

<code>
CREATE OR REPLACE viewName AS
	SELECT 
		columnA, 
		columnB 
	FROM tableName 
	WHERE columnC <> value;
</code>

#Delete

<code>
DROP VIEW viewName;
</code>
