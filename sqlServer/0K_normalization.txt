##Normalization

Normalization is the act of designing a database to conform to one of the "normal forms".
The aim is to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
Normalized databases should also be extensible without editing the existing design.

This involves organizing tables and columns so that data constraints can be enforced by the database.

Synthesis: creating a new database design.
Decomposition: improving an existing database design.

#Forms

UNF: Unnormalized Form
1NF: First Normal Form
2NF: Second Normal Form
3NF: Third Normal Form
EKNF: Elementary Key Normal Form
BCNF: Boyce-Codd Normal Form
4NF: Fourth Normal Form
ETNF: Essential Tuple Normal Form
5NF: Fifth Normal Form
DKNF: Domain-Key Normal Form
6NF: Sixth Normal Form

Some general aims:
- reduce the number of NULL values being stored
- enable efficient indexing
- each column should hold one data type
- columns should not hold lists/etc of data, just atomic data

#Denormalize

A denormalized database, such as one single giant table with many columns, can be used to increase query speed since all the joins are already done.
