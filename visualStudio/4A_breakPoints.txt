##Breakpoints

#Keyboard Shortcuts

F9 to add/remove breakpoint on the current line.

There is no default shortcut to disable all breakpoints, but you can do this from Debug > Disable All Breakpoints.

#Breakpoints Window

Open with: Debug menu > Windows > Breakpoints
Or: Ctrl-Alt-B

You can:
- Deactivate breakpoints without deleting them (just uncheck the line)
- Set a condition on when the breakpoint is used (ex: 124th iteration of loop)
- WhenHit lets you output a message to the Output Window instead of breaking
