##Security

shared responsibility model: AWS manages security "of" the cloud, customer manages the security "in" the cloud

aws responsible
- physical layer
- network layer
- hypervisor layer

customer
- operating system (when on EC2, when not serverless)
- applications
- data

AWS root account user: the user will complete access to your whole system
- do not use this often, create other users with granular access

multifactor authentication (MFA)
- requires a randomized token to login

#AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM)

create new users
- by default, they have no permissions
- create an IAM policy and associate it to a user to grant them access
  - IAM policy: a json document that lists the api calls the user can make
  - can also use groups to connect users and policies
  - can use roles to give temporary permissions for an amount of time
    - an identity will assume a role, and ignore all its normal permissions for a time

least privileged principle: give users minimal access to what they need

#AWS Organizations

manage multiple AWS accounts, separate resources
- centralized management
- consolidated billing
- hierarchical groupings of accounts
  - organize into OU (Organizational Units)
- service and api action access control
