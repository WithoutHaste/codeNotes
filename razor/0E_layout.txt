##Layout

#_ViewStart

File ~/Views/ViewStart.cshtml will run before each view, by default.
This is where the environment variable "Layout" is set to its default value of "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml".

#Layout

The environment variable "Layout" is a string filepath to the layout that should be used with the current view.

Use no layout:
<code>
@model MyModel
@{
	Layout = null;
	//or
	Layout = "";
}
</code>
