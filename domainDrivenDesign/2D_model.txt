##Domain Models

A domain model is made up of many object.

#Anemic Domain Model

An anemic model is focused on the state of its objects. The object don't have much behavior.

For example, objects with many fields/properties and just basic CRUD logic.

#Rich Domain Model

The objects contain the business logic directly.

This is recommended in domain driven design.
