##Promises

Promises are like event listeners, but they can only be triggered once, and they can be triggered by a state that has already occurred.

<code>
img1.ready().then(function() {
  // run if image is already loaded, or becomes loaded
}, function() {
  // run if image has failed or does fail to load
});

Promise.all([img1.ready(), img2.ready()]).then(function() {
  // run if all are already loaded, or when they all become loaded
}, function() {
  // run if one or more failed, or when one fails in the future
});

//succeed or fail based on the first event to happen
Promise.race([img.ready(), img2.ready()])...
</code>

A promise is pending until the action succeeds or fails.
A promise is settled once the action succeeds or fails.
A promise is fulfilled if the action succeeds.
A promise is rejected if the action fails.
