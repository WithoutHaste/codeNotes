##Network

#Troubleshooting

(linux is not recognizing LAN connection)

list connections
<code>
ifconfig
</code>
should at least see a "lo" for local host
may also see "eth0" for ethernet connection

list PCI devices
<code>
lspci
</code>
lists all devices, such as VGA Controller, Audio, Ethernet, USB, SATA, PCI Bridge, etc
(I'm seeing the two expected ethernet controllers listed)

list hardware, filtering for network
<code>
sudo lshw -c network
</code>
(I'm seeing "*-network DISABLED" at the top)
look at the configuration line to see what driver is needed
(I need e1000e 3.2.6-k or r8169

list drivers
<code>
lsmod | sort
</code>
see if the driver listed in lshw is also here
(I see both drivers I could use listed here)

seems that "ifconfig" has been deprecated
and "ip" is recommended instead

list connections
<code>
ip link
</code>
(now I see "lo" local connection plus my two ethernet options, both say "state DOWN")

enable a DOWN connection
<code>
sudo ip link set <LINKID> up 
</code>
(YESSSSSS, I can now see this connection listed under "ifconfig" and router connection has lit up)
(but I don't see an "inet" line for it, with the ip address)

(still seems to not be connected to the internet, for instance cannot install new package)

(rebooting)
(ethernet connection is DOWN again after reboot, so set it to UP again)
("ip addr" shows "LOWER_UP" which blog says means the other end of the connection exists)

check that ethernet card is working
<code>
ethtool <LINKID>
 #example: ethtool eth0
</code>
(dislays "Link detected: yes" so that is working)

TODO try rebooting the router
