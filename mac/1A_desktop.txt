##Desktop

#Lock Screen

closing the laptop lid does not cause the screen to lock
go to Apple Menu > Lock Screen

#Apps

switch app - hold COMMAND + press TAB + use arrow keys to scroll through apps, or keep clicking Tab to scroll

force-quit app - OPTION + COMMAND + Escape

"right click" in Windows generally equals "CONTROL + click" in Mac

start a Snip operation - COMMAND + SHIFT + 4

#Dock

the "Dock" is the bottom row of icons

remove icon from Dock - click and hold on icon > drag outward from Dock until "remove" appears > release icon

with multiple monitors, moving your mouse to the bottom of the screen that does not have the Dock will cause the Dock to migrate to that screen
