##About

The ADO.Net Entity Framework is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
A tool for simplifying your Data Access Layer.

It's used to convert data between two incompatible type systems (in this case, between a relational database and a .Net object-oriented language).
It allows you to work with relational data as domain-specific objects.

Entity Framework automates databased-related activities so you don't have to write all the ADO.Net code yourself.
This guarantees consistency in the generated SQL, and saves time.
Creates connections, creates and executes commands.

Queries are issued using LINQ To Entities, data is returned as strongly-typed objects.

Also provides services like:
	change tracking
	identity resolution
	lazy loading
	query translation
	
Entity Framework can be pointed at many possible databases: SQL Server, SQL Compact, an Azure cloud, Oracle, DB2, etc.
