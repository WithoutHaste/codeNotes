##ScriptableObjects

Scriptable objects do not need to be added to GameObjects in a scene, they are simply Assets.

Scriptable objects are serializable objects.
They let you store large quantities of shared data independent of script instances.
Frequently used just as data containers.

Define global variable:
<code>
[CreateAssetMenu]
public class Stats : ScriptableObject
{
	public int Strength;
	public int Dexterity;
	public int Intelligence;
}
</code>
You can add a "Stats" type field anywhere in the code, and they will all be editing this one shared object.
For instance, one MonoBehavior could update Stats.Strength and another could read it to display in the GUI.

The intended usage of ScriptableObjects is:
1) create the ScriptableObject script
2) create instances of the ScriptableObject with specific data values set
Ex: one "InventoryItem" ScriptableObject, and then instances for "Armor", "Weapon", etc.

#Fields

As with normal Scripts, all public non-static fields will be visible in the Inspector pane.

You can also make private non-static fields visible by marking them "serializable".
<code>
[SerializeField]
private int goldAmount;
</code>

#Events

Awake() is called when a ScriptableObject instance is created in a script.

Start() is not used on ScriptableObjects.

OnEnable() is called when the the ScriptableObject is loaded.
This does not seem to work when calling Static methods on the object without creating an instance of it.

#Asset Menu

You can configure any ScriptableObject to be listed in the normal Assets > Create menu.

<code>
[CreateAssetMenu]
public class MyObject : ScriptableObject
{
}
</code>
Now you can easily create instances of this object in your project.

<code>
[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "DefaultFileName", menuName = "AssetMenuLabel", order = 51)]
public class MyObject : ScriptableObject
{
}
</code>
fileName: default file name of new instances of object
menuName: how this object is labeled in the Asset > Create menu
order: where in the Asset > Create menu this object will show up
- the normal options are in reserved indexes 0 - 50
