##Icons

(If just using icons within an application, you can load your own or use the SystemIcons enum)

You will need to set the icon file for each Form you want it displayed on. Do not do it this way:
<code>
myForm.Icon = new Icon("icon.ico");
</code>
Even if the icon file has has property Build Action set to Embedded Resource, the installed executable will not be able to find the file.

Instead:
1) Open project properties > Application tab
2) Select "Icon and Manifest" option
3) Select your *.ico icon file
- the file will be automatically copied to the project's root folder
4) Open the properties for the icon file located in the project's root folder
5) Set "Build Action" as "Embedded Resource"
6) Set "Copy to Output Directory" to "Copy if Newer" or "Always Copy"

To use the icon:
<code>
using System.IO;
using System.Reflection;

Assembly myAssembly = Assembly.GetAssembly(typeof(anyTypeInAssembly));
Stream iconStream = myAssembly.GetManifestResourceStream("MyFullNamespace.iconFilename.ico");
this.Icon = new Icon(iconStream);
</code>
