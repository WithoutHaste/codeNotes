##Glossary

#API

Application Programming Interface

A service endpoint that another program can call to query for data, or have some piece of work done.

#Bulkhead

Metaphor

"If one component of a system fails, but that failure doesn't cascade, you can isolate the problem and the rest of the system can carry on working."

A bulkhead in a ship separates the ship into multiple water-tight segments (among other purposes). If one part of the ship leaks, only part of the ship will be flooded.

Having "bulkheads" in a software system increases the resiliency of the system.

Application Platform as a Service (aPaaS)
