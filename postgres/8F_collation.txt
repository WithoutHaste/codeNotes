##Collation

What non-standard collations are being used?
<code>
select table_schema, 
       table_name, 
       column_name,
       collation_name
from information_schema.columns
where collation_name is not null
order by table_schema,
         table_name,
         ordinal_position;
</code>

#UTF-8

PSQl supports the "utf8_general_ci" collation directly. This can store more special characters than the basic latin collations can.
