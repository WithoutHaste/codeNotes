##Controllers

#Basic

A controller is a single class that is made up of public methods called "Actions".
HTTP requests will be routed to a particular controller based on the name of the class (pattern "XController", where "X" is used in the route).

<code>
class MyController : IController 
{
	public void Execute() { ... } //runs the Action Invoker
}

//you'll usually derive from MVC's abstract controller class
class MyController : Controller { }
</code>

#Controller Factory

<code>
class MyControllerFactory : IControllerFactory { }
//you'll usually use the default DefaultControllerFactory
</code>

#Scaffolding

When adding a new controller through Visual Studio, there are many template options that can generate boiler-plate code based on a Model and basic Create/View/Edit/Delete actions.
