##Misc Commands

#NOCOUNT

This prevents the default message about "rows affected by query" from being displayed; also prevents DONE_IN_PROC messages from stored procedures.
<code>
SET NOCOUNT ON;
</code>
Commonly used in Stored Procedures and Triggers. Turning this I/O operation off can significantly improve performance.

Allow the default message to be displayed.
<code>
SET NOCOUNT OFF;
</code>

#UPDATE STATISTICS

Updates query optimization statistics on a table or indexed view.

This already runs by default, but you can call it more frequently yourself. Don't do it constantly, though, because it causes affected queries to re-compile.

<code>
UPDATE STATISTICS tableNameOrViewName indexName;
</code>

#@@ROWCOUNT

Returns the number of rows affected by the last statement.
<code>
SET @count = @@ROWCOUNT;
</code>
