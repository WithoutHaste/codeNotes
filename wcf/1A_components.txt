#Contracts

The data contracts and service contracts are the only thing shared between client and service, either through a shared assembly or through contract equivalence.
- It is recommended to put just the contracts into a single assembly, so they are easy to share between service and clients.

#Contract Equivalence

Contract names and member/operation names must match.  Each of the attributes (DataContract, DataMember, ServiceContract, OperationContract) has an optional Name property so you can specify an outward-facing name.

<code>
[OperationContract(Name="matchingName")]
</code>

Contract namespaces must also match.  Each of the four attributes also has an optional Namespace property.

<code>
[ServiceContract(Namespace="matchingNamespace")]
</code>

You can also specify the namespace at the assembly level.
In your project's Properties > Assembly.cs:
<code>
//add line
[assembly:ContractNamespace("old", ClrNamespace="new")]
</code>
