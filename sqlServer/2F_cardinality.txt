##Cardinality

#1 to 1

A 1 to 1 relationship is usually in a single table.

#1 to Many

A 1 to Many relationship is a simple Foreign Key constraint.

Let TableB have a foreign key constraint to TableA. Now 1 record in TableA can be related to Many records in TableB.

#Many to Many

A Many to Many relationship between two tables requires an intermediate table.

TableC has one column with a foreign key constraint to TableA, and one column with a foreign key constraint to TableB.

Ex: A SalesPeople table can have a Many to Many relationship with a Customers table. Each SalesPerson may work with multiple Customers, and over time each Customer may work with multiple SalesPeople.
