##Analysis Patterns

From Martin Fowler's "Analysis Patterns" on the conceptual structure of business processes that are applicable to many domains because they share the similarities of being businesses.

These notes are a first sketch of the concepts.

#Accountability

When one party or organization is responsible to another.  Applicable to organizational structure, contracts, employment, etc.

Party: an individual or an organization. A group of any size that acts as a whole.
	E.g. a Party can have a phone number, address, email, bank accounts, taxes, etc
	
Organization Hierarchy
<code>
//Business model
Sales Offices report to Divisions report to Regions report to Operating Unit

//Object model
public abstract class Organization //or interface Organization
{
	Organization parent;
	List<Organization> subsidiaries;
}

class OperatingUnit : Organization { ... } //parent must remain null
classs Region : Organization { ... } //parent must be an OperatingUnit
class Division : Organization { ... } //parent must be a Region
class SalesOffice : Organization { ... } //parent must be a Division
</code>

Often there are two more overlapping hiearchies within one organization. You can track both hiearchies in one object, or break them into entirely different objects.
<code>
public abstract class Organization
{
	Organization salesParent;
	List<Organization> salesSubsidiaries;
	
	Organization productParent;
	List<Organization> productSubsidiaries;
}
</code>
