##Basic

An open-source Facebook project.

React/ReactJS was invented to manipulate website DOM faster than Javascript Core, using a virtual DOM model.
React/ReactJS is a Javascript library.
React/ReactJS can run on the front or back end.

React Native was built after React, as a platform for building native apps using Javascript. (As opposed to using Java on Android and Objective-C on iPhone)
React Native is built on ReactJS.
To run a React Native app, you'll need XCode (Mac) or Android Studio (Android).
React Native does not use HTML to render the app; instead it uses native UI components.

Prerequisites: Javascript, HTML

Continuation of notes apply to React 16/17/18

React is a JS library for building UIs
A React UI is a composition of components
Create hierarchies of reusable components
Rendered output changes when the state changes
Reconciliation will only update the parts of the UI that need to be updated

When a component function is invoked, that is "rendering" - it generates the JSX which will be converted into HTML DOM elements.
When React updates what the browser is displaying, that is "reconciliation".
