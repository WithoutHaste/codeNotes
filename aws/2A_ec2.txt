##Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

for computations

compute-as-a-service model

can share host server with other instances (virtual machines)
- multitenancy
- hypervisor manages the server running multiple instances
- instances are secure and separate from each other

vertically scaling an instance
- take more or less resources (memory, cpus)

instance types
- each type in grouped under an instance family, and is optimized for different tasks
- families
  - general purpose: balanced resources, ok for web services and small/medium databases
  - compute optimized: intensive computing, ok for gaming servers, an intensely used web services, and batch processing
  - memory optimized: for processing large datasets in memory
  - accelerated computing: hardware accelerators, ok for graphics, data pattern matching, floating point calculations
  - storage optimized: for high sequential read/write access to large datasets, ok for distributed file systems, data warehousing, and OLTP (online transaction processing)

auto-scaling of instances
- scale up: add more power/resources to the existing instances
- scale out: add more instances
- set min and max capacity, plus desired capacity (the amount to use by default)
