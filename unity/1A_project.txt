##Project

The project pane shows a directory listing of all the project files, with detailed contents of the selected folder on the side.

Adding files to the project in Windows Explorer automatically adds them to the project in Unity.

The slider on the bottom-right of the pane changes the detail view icon size. Increase the size to make longer file names visible.
