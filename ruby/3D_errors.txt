##Errors/Exceptions

#Error Types

syntax errors
no method errors
runtime errors

#Error Handling

"begin", "rescue", "end" are working together
<code>
begin
	puts 10/0
rescue StandardError => e
	puts "an error occurred: #{e.message}"
end
</code>

#Pry

from the standard Gem "pry", for complex scenarios
a more powerful tool than binding.irb

add this line into your code where you want to debug
<code>
require'pry';binding.pry
</code>
the terminal will open a pry prompt you can work in
type "exit" to exit this pry, and execution will continue to the next one
