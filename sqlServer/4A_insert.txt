##Insert

#Default Order

Insert values in the default order:
<code>
INSERT INTO tableName VALUES (3, 'Texas', '2015/09/30');
</code>

#Custom Order

Insert values in a specific order:
<code>
INSERT INTO tableName (columnB, columnD, columnA) VALUES ('Texas', 343.55, 3);
</code>

#Transfer Data

You can also transfer data between tables with SELECT INTO:
<code>
-- for creating new tables, such as temp tables
SELECT * INTO tableB FROM tableA WHERE columnA = value;

SELECT * INTO backupTable IN 'filename.mdb' FROM tableA;

-- for inserting into existing tables
INSERT INTO backupTable SELECT * FROM tableA;

INSERT INTO backupTable (columnA, columnB) SELECT columnA, columnB FROM tableA;
</code>

#Bulk Insert

Bulk insert data from file.

<code>
BULK INSERT TableName
FROM 'fileNameWithFullPath.csv'
WITH (FIRSTROW = 2, --1st row is headers, skip it
    FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
	ROWTERMINATOR='\n' );
</code>
The data needs to be in the same order as the table columns, and cover all columns.

For identity columns: include the column in the CSV file, but leave the data blank.

You cannot bulk insert multiple tables at once, where the tables have foreign key relations. Instead, bulk insert into a staging table and run a script to relate the data.

Note that BULK INSERT does not support parameterization from (for instance) C# code. The entire query must be entered as one string.

I've had trouble with BULK INSERT when the last column is a BIT. It works fine from SSMS, but from C# it gives a conversion error. This does not happen if the BIT column has other columns after it.

Errors:
- "Unexpected end of file" may indicate that you have too many columns in the data file.

To bulk insert special characters (such as "āiḤjĭä"):
(1) Save the csv file with Unicode encoding.
- In C#, the command is like "new StreamWriter(fileName, append: false, encoding: Encoding.Unicode);"
(2) Set column types to "N" columns (such as NVARCHAR instead of VARCHAR).
(3) Import with "DATAFILETYPE ='widechar'"
<code>
BULK INSERT TableName
FROM 'fileNameWithFullPath.csv'
WITH (FIRSTROW = 2,
    FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
	ROWTERMINATOR='\n',
	DATAFILETYPE ='widechar');
</code>

To view details of errors, such as the line number that failed import
<code>
BULK INSERT TableName
FROM 'fileNameWithFullPath.csv'
WITH (FIRSTROW = 2,
    FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
	ROWTERMINATOR='\n',
	ERRORFILE = 'C:\temp\dbErrors.log');
</code>
