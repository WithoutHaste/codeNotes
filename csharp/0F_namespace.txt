##Namespaces

Namespaces have a nested structure. Each segment of a namespace like "System.Collections.Generic" is a namespace:
- System
- Collections within System
- Generic within Collections

Nested namespaces may be declared two ways:
<code>
namespace System.Collections { }
//or
namespace System 
{
	namespace Collections { }
}
</code>

The fully qualified name of a type includes the full namespaces it is within:
- System.Collections.Generic.List<T>

Fully qualified names must be unique within a program.

You cannot declare a namespace within a class, interface, or struct.

C# 10 File-scoped namespaces
<code>
namespace A.B.C;

public class MyClass 
{
}
</code>
One allowed per file. Must be above all type declarations.

#Naming Convention

The conventional organization of a project is for the namespaces to correspond to the file structure.
- Files at the root of the project are in namespace "MyProject".
- Files in folder root/Contracts are in namespace "MySpace.Contracts".
- And so on.

#Including Libraries

(Rules determined by experimentation)

Library-A: the .Net library you are making.
Library-B: a third-party library you are using within Library-A.

When making Library-A, you can make use of Library-B internally in your project without making it necessary for users of Library-A to also add a reference to Library-B in their project.

When will users of Library-A need to add a reference to Library-B?
- When calling a Library-A method with Library-B Type arguments.
- When calling a Library-A method that returns a Library-B Type, whether or not they capture the return value.
- When referencing a Library-B Type property or field in a Library-A Type object.

Therefore, third-party dependency considerations should not affect how you divide your namespaces. Merely including the namespace in your project does not incur additional references.

Additionally, Visual Studio IntelliSense will report exactly which library you are missing when you try to use a Library-B type.

When referencing Library-B, they will need to reference the same version that Library-A uses.
