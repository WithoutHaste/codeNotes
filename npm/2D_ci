##npm ci

Install a project with a clean slate. Ensures clean install of dependencies.
Intended for automated environments - skips certain user-oriented features that "npm install" would have included.

More strict than "npm install" - can catch errors that incrementally-installed environments would not.

From the project's root folder:
<code>
npm ci
</code>
