##AWS Global Infrastructure

#About

Amazon has data centers located all over the world
- they are organized into regions
- this is helpful for providing high availability, because a disaster in one region does not block processing in other regions
- regions are built to be geographically close to high-demand population centers
- the regions are interconnected
- users can decide which region to run their services out of
  - you data is only stored and handled in the region(s) you specify (for security)
- the AWS features available vary between regions
- pricing varies between regions

availability zone (AZ "ay-zed"): one or more discrete data center
- reach region is made up of one or more availability zones
- a single EC2 instance will only run in one data center
  - run multiple instances so they can run in multiple data centers, and even in multiple availability zones
- the geographically distributed availability zones provide high availability

#AWS Outposts
