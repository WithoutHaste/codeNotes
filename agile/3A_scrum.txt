##Scrum

"Scrum is a light-weight management framework for iterative and incremental projects."

Scrum finds software development runs more smoothly when teams are feed with objectives instead of tasks.
"Teams required autonomy to achieve excellence."

Scrum is widely popular.

The Scrum process is a series of "sprints", 2-4 weeks each.
