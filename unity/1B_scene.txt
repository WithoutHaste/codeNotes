##Scene

The scene pane shows the current scene you are working on.

A scene is general a game level or a menu.
Scenes are saved under "Assets/Scenes".

You can drag assets around the scene.

If you select the "hand" icon in the upper-left of the screen, you can drag the scene around to look at different parts of it.

Zoom Out: Alt + Right-Click and drag mouse upward
Zoom In: Alt + Right-Click and drag mouse downward

Above the scene are the "Play/Stop", "Pause", and something else buttons. Use these to test the scene.
