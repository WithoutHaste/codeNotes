## Import

Import functionality from libraries so you can use them in your code.
<code>
import "fmt"
</code>
"fmt" package comes from the standard library

Multiple imports are separated by a line break
<code>
import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)
</code>

You'll get a compile-time error if you import a package without using it.
