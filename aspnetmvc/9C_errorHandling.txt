##Error Handling

#HTTP Result

When an exception occurs while processing an HTTP Request, the programmer will see the "yellow error page" returned. It has a lot of detailed information about the error. This should not be shown to normal users, both for security reasons and ease-of-use reasons.

ASP.Net helps by only showing the "yellow error page" when the HTTP request originated from the same machine that the application is running on (the developer's computer). Otherwise, a more generic error page will be shown.

For a developer to see the generic error page:
- Open Web.config
- Add the "customErrors" section as shown:
<code>
  <system.web>
    <customErrors mode="On"/> <!-- default is "RemoteOnly" -->
  </system.web>
</code>
- save changes (changes to this file will cause the application to restart if it is already running)
- refresh the web page to see the error page that users will see

The default error page is at Project/Views/Shared/Error.cshtml.
Redirecting to this view is setup in Project/App_Start/FilterConfig.cs > RegisterGlobalFilters.
