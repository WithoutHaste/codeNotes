##Agile

Agile is a software development process that allows for the evolution of requirements over time. The Agile Manifesto was first published in 2001.

It promotes:
- Adaptive Planning
- Evolutionary Development
- Early Delivery

The aim of Agile is frequent delivery of working software, starting with the Minimum Viable Product, and gradually adding more features.
This allows you to prioritize the most valuable features first, and deliver them to the business long before the entire project is complete.

#Agile Manifesto

"We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
- Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
- Working Software over comprehensive documentation
- Custom Collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to Change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more."

#Principles

Regular delivery of software:
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
(This principle indicates that overworking your staff is counter to the Agile principles, as it not sustainable.)

Team communication:
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

Excellence in design:
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essential.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
