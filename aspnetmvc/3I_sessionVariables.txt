##Session Variables

#TempData

A dictionary maintaining data between controllers and actions, even over redirect requests.

Once you view a piece of data in TempData, it is automatically set to NULL.

<code>
TempData.Keep[key] //TempData will keep the value of the key even though you viewed it
TempData.Peek[key] //Lets you view the value of key without deleting it
</code>

#ViewData 

A dictionary maintaining data between controllers and views, ie. the data can be set in the controller and used in the view.

#ViewBag

A dynamic wrapper around ViewData. You can add dynamic properties to ViewBag.
