##Versions

#6 vs 7

EF 6 was the first version of Entity Framework not embedded in a .Net Framework - it is just a NuGet package. It is also open-source.
!![EF is open-source on CodePlex](entityframework.codeplex.com)
(CodePlex includes some EF extensions that are not part of the full release of EF.)

EF 6 is backwards compatible to EF 4.

EF 7 is a fresh rewrite of Entity Framework.
EF 7 is not backward compatible with EF 6.
EF 7 uses 3rd party visual designers instead of the EF 6 Microsoft designer.
EF 7 can work on .Net Core, and also works on the full .Net Framework.
EF 7 is broken in smaller pieces, you can select what you need.
EF 7 supports non-relational databases.

EF 6 and EF 7 will be supported in parallel for some time.

These notes are focused on EF 6.

#6 Versions

From experience, EF 6.2 works fine with Visual Studio 2015, but EF 6.3 causes reference errors in Visual Studio 2015.

#Pre-6

Entity Framework began embedded in .Net 3.5.
EF4 (numbered to match the .Net Framework) was embedded in .Net 4.0.

EF 4.1 through 4.3 were NuGet extensions to EF 4.
It added "Code First" modeling and the "DbContext" object (sitting in front of the ObjectContext).

EF 5 was embedded in .Net 4.5 along with a new NuGet extension for it.
It had a lot of performance improvements, enum support, among other things.
