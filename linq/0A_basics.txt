##About

LINQ stands for Language Integrated Query.

It is a .Net query language used against strongly-typed objects.

To use LINQ in C#:
<code>
using System.Linq;
</code>

LINQ queries are strongly-typed.

LINQ to Objects let you run queries against IEnumerables. It is a declarative language that is easier to read/write than the nested foreach loops it replaces.

#Deferred Execution

LINQ builds up a query, and does not actually execute it until you run an operation that requires it.

<code>
using System.Linq;

var list = from x in fullList where x.Property < 5 select x; 
//query has not been run yet

int count = list.Count(); 
//query was run so that count could be performed
</code>
