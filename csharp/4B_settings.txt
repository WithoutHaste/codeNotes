##Settings

Application-level settings can only be edited during design, or in the <Application>.exe.config file between application sessions.

User-level settings can be edited and saved during run-time.

<code>
Color myColor = Properties.Settings.Default.myColor;
Properties.Settings.Default.myColor = Color.AliceBlue; 
Properties.Settings.Default.Save(); 
</code>
