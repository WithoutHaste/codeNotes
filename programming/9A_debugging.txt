#When You Have No Idea What's Wrong

Test in different environments.

Log everything. Step through everything that you have access to.

Run in debug mode and step through the code one statement at a time. Watch the variable values changing.

Watch the network traffic. Use browser Dev Tools, use Fiddler.

Verify everything, every little step in the whole process.

Verify the environment is setup correctly.

Verify all settings.

Verify you're looking at the right logs, the right queues, the right monitors.
- just wasted time looking at the wrong environment

Verify your reports and monitors are reliable.
- just found out the tool I'm using is only about 95% accurate
