##Scope

to do

#Multiple Scopes

You can create multiple private scopes within one method. One possible use is to ensure that a variable is not used after its purpose is complete.

<code>
public void MyMethod()
{
	{
		int a = 5;
	}
	//variable a is not valid here
	
	{
		//variable a is not valid here either
		int b = 7;
	}
}
</code>

It is generally recommended to decompose a large method into several smaller methods instead.

#Nested Scopes

You can now have local functions nested inside of functions/methods
They have access to the scope of their parent
