##Collection

A collection contains multiple Documents.

A collection is analogous to a SQL Table.

#Dynamic Schema

MongoDb Collections do not enforce a schema, meaning that documents in the same collection do not have to have the same fields.
Fields with the same Key do not need to contain the same data types.
