# Online

Online editor to practice Go in:

# Locally

Install Go:
- Download Go from https://go.dev/
  - try to use the default installation location, to avoid integration issues later
- Open Command Prompt
  - verify installation worked by running "go version"
  
Install an IDE:
- Visual Studio Code is recommended by the walkthrough I'm watching
- Install Go plugin
  - Extensions (left-hand nav pane) > search for Go > install the Go Plugin
  - click Ctrl+Shift+P to open Command Window > search for "Go: Install/Update Tools" > select all the suggested tools > run this to install the tools
  
If the tool starts acting up, run "Go: Install/Update Tools" again as a first step.

Start an application
- Visual Studio Code > new file
- Save file as "main.go"
- type in the Hello World program
- run it with command prompt > "go run main.go"
  - program is compiled and executed
