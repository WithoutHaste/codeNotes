##Pipes

Utilities in Linux can be formed into a pipeline where the output of one command becomes the input of another.

#Pipe

Forward (left to right) pipeline
<code>
head FileName | sort | awk '{print}'
</code>

#STDIN

You can use a backwards redirection (not sure that's the official name) to provide STDIN to a utility.
<code>
sort < FileName
</code>
FileName is the STDIN for sort.

STDIN will be executed before pipes.
<code>
sort < FileName | tail
</code>
So this will sort the file, then print the tail.

You can group commands with parentheses
<code>
tail < (sort FileName)
</code>
So this will sort the file, then print the tail.
At least, I've read that you can do this. It doesn't work in my environment (Bash 4.1.2).
- "You cannot pass file descriptors over SSH. <(...) creates virtual files on your system and does not have a meaning when executing on a remote system." That would explain it, I'm using a remote system.

#STDOUT

Save the output of a utility to a file
<code>
sort FileName > NewFileName
</code>
