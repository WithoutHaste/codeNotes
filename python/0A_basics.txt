##Basics

The python file extension is *.py

To execute (assuming Python is in your PATH variable) run "python myFile.py" from the console.

Python is interpreted, not compiled. (Although it can be compiled.)
Python has garbage collection.
Python is dynamically typed. (The type of a variable can change during runtime, and type checking occurs at runtime.)
Python supports both functional and object-oriented programming paradigms.

These notes focus on Python 3, not Python 2.

Goals of the language:
- "there is only one way to do each thing"
- "focuses on simplicity"

the "eval" method will parse what is passed in as Python and run it
<code>
eval("2+2") #returns 4
</code>
