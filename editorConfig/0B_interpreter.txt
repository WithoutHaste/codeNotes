##Interpreter

.editorconfig files can be used in a hierarchy.

Lower-level configs override higher-level configs.

Set "root=true" in the preamble to say "don't look for a high-level config, this is it".

Anywhere a .editorconfig is found when in your project, the IDE searches upward in the directories until it finds a "root" or reaches the root of the filesystem.

.editorconfig files are read top-to-bottom.
Lower-down rules can override higher-up rules.
