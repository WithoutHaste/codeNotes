##AutoMapper

AutoMapper is an object-to-object mapper.

#Cons

I don't recommend AutoMapper because it does not give compile-time errors for using a mapping that is not configured. Instead, it throws a runtime exception: "AutoMapper.AutoMapperMappingException: 'Missing type map configuration or unsupported mapping.'"

<code>
MyMapperProfile myMapper = new MyMapperProfile();
ToClass toObject = myMapper.Map<ToClass>(fromObject); //this throws an exception
</code>
