##Variables

Variables are not declared. They are created when they are first assigned.

#Naming Conventions

Begin with a letter or underscore
Continue with letters, numbers, or underscores
Names are case-sensitive
Only start with an underscore for special variables

#Assignment

<code>
x = 1
y = "a"
z = 1 * 5 + 7 / 4

x = y = z = 1 #all equal 1 now

x,y,z = 1,"a",4+5 #x=1, y="a", z=9
</code>

You can swap variables in a single line.
<code>
x,y = 1,2 #x=1 and y=2
x,y = y,x #now x=2 and y=1
</code>

#Naming Collisions

Python will let you name variables the same as modules, as objects, as functions. If you do so, the variable overwrites the previous "value".

For example, if you name a variable "sum" and then try to use the built-in sum function, you'll get an error.
