#Sync Inherited NuGet Package

Scenario: 
- MyProject references NuGet package version 1.0
- TestProject references MyProject and inherits the NuGet package reference 1.0
- I update MyProject to reference version 1.1
- TestProject is still referencing version 1.0

Solution:
- In TestProject, remove dependency/reference to MyProject
- In TestProject, add dependency/referene to MyProject back in

This will force TestProject to update its inherited NuGet references.
