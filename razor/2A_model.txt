##Model

#Strongly Typed

A strongly-typed view expects a particular data type to be passed in as its model. Declare the data type at the top of the file, like this:

<code>
@model DataType
</code>

#Naming Convention

The variable "Model" is automatically available within your view.

When using a lambda expression, do not use "Model". Use something like "model" or "m" instead. It can cause problems to step on the name of the actual model variable.
