##Swagger

#Swagger Specification

The Swagger Specification is a text format for documenting RESTful APIs.

The Swagger Specification was renamed to the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) when Swagger donated it to the OpenAPI Initiative.

#Swagger UI

Swagger UI is a tool that will translate your OAS into an interactive API console.
