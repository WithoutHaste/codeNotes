!![Steamworks.Net](https://steamworks.github.io/)
Download Steamworks.Net, which is a C# wrapper for Valve Steamworks API. Free to use.

Follow the installation instructions, or this:
1. Open your project in Unity
2. Double-click on the downloaded *.unitypackage from the latest release on Github
- you should see a "Steamworks.Net" popup in Unity now
3. Click "Import" on the popup
- adds Assets/Editor/Steamworks.NET
- adds Assets/Plugins/Steamworks.NET, steam_api.bundle, x86, x86_64
- adds Assets/Scripts/Steamworks.NET

4. Look at file <project root>/steam_appid.txt
- it will come with default value "480"
5. Replace the default steam_appid.txt value with the id for your game

6. Create an empty GameObject in your default Scene, call it "SteamManager"
7. Drag-n-drop the script "Assets/Scripts/Steamworks.NET/SteamManager" into the Inspector for "SteamManager"
8. Open the "SteamManager" script in Visual Studio
9. Search for default value "480" to find this line:
<code>
if (SteamAPI.RestartAppIfNecessary(AppId_t.Invalid)) {
</code>
10. Replace "AppId_t.Invalid" with your Steam app id, the same value as in "steam_appid.txt"
<code>
if (SteamAPI.RestartAppIfNecessary((AppId_t)myActualAppId)) {
</code>
11. Save changes

(There's another edit in the tutorial. I'll add it if it turns out to be necessary.)

#Achievements

1. Setup your achievements in the Steamworks website
- each achievement will have a unique id set by you AND a unique id set by Steam

2. Open your project in Unity
3. Create an empty GameObject in your default Scene, call it "SteamAchievements"
4. Add your custom achievements script to this GameObject
