##See Commits By File

See that commits that affected one file. Does not track file renaming well (see "git log path").

Displays summary of each commit that affected the file.
<code>
git log --follow -- FileName
</code>
Click "space" to see more results.
Click "q" to exit the viewer.

Displays actual before/after edits for each commit that affected the file.
<code>
git log -p FileName
</code>

Searches commits for specific strings
<code>
git log -p -S 'mystring'
</code>

Suggested for when someone makes changes, but forgets where they made them.
<code>
git log --all --first-parent --remotes --reflog --author-date-order -- FileName
</code>

I've found "git log -p FileName" to be the most useful for finding when a particular edit was made.
