query example
<code>
fields @timestamp, @message
| sort @timestamp desc
| filter @message ~= "provisioning"
</code>
get fields:timestamp and message
sort: by timestamp descending
where: message includes the text "provisioning"

fields can be parsed with regex
each * part will be output as a new named field
<code>
# with @message format 'stuff stuff,"@l":"Debug",stuff stuff'

fields @timestamp, @message
| parse @message '*"@l":"*"*' as message_before, loggingType, message_after
| filter loggingType = "Error"
| display loggingType, message_after #or comment out this line to see full messages as normal
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20
</code>
another way to get this filtering is
<code>
fields @timestamp as Timestamp, @@l as LogLevel, ServiceName, @@m
| filter LogLevel == "Error"
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20
</code>
or more specifically for current job
<code>
fields @timestamp as Timestamp, @@l as LogLevel, ServiceName, @@m
| filter LogLevel != "Error" and LogLevel != "Verbose" and LogLevel != "Debug"  and not isblank(LogLevel)
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20
</code>
