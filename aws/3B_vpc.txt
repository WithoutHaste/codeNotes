##Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

your own private network within AWS
- define your ip range
- can define what traffic can enter the VPC

internet gateway (IGW): an access point for public traffic to enter your VPC
- (this is not automatic)

virtual private gateway: an access point for private traffic (encrypted internet traffic) to enter you VPC
- (this is not automatic)
- make a VPN connection between a private network and your VPC

AWS direct connect:
- a dedicated private connection (not shared with normal internet traffic)
- a dedicated fiber connection (wire) between your data center and an AWS data center

gateways are configured to be "traffic in" or "traffic out"

subnets: used to control access to the gateways
- public subnets have access to the internet gateways
- has a Network ACL

network access control lists (Network ACL)
- define which packets are allowed to cross the boundary? in either direction
- stateless: checks every single packet
- allows all in and out traffic by default

security groups
- ECS instance level access security
  - what traffic is allowed to access a particular ECS instance?
  - by default, no incoming traffic is accepted and all outgoing traffic is allowed
- stateful: has some memory for what to allow in
  - will allow the responses to outgoing packets back in
