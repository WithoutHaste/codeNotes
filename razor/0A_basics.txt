## Razor

Razor is the new syntax/view engine that replaces the old Web Forms (ASPX) syntax/view engine. It is simpler and easier to read.

Razor pages have file extension *.cshtml or *.vbhtml, depending on which language you use. These notes are all based on the C# (.cshtml) syntax.

#Template

Razor views are templates that are filled in with data to produce web pages.

Literal strings are plain HTML. C# code starts with an "@".

<code>
@{ var message = "Good morning"; }
<p>Message says @message.</p>
</code>

<code>
@{ var student = new Student("Bob", 19); }
<p>Student name is @student.Name and age is @student.Age.</p>
<p>Student is in @student.CountClasses() classes.</p>
</code>

The Model and the ViewBag are both available in the view.

#Comments

<code>
@* comments here *@
</code>

<code>
@{
	//more comments
	/* multiline comments */
}
</code>

#Code Block

These lines are executed. Nothing is automatically added to the output.

<code>
@{
	//proper C# code;
}
</code>

#Inline Expressions

These results are added directly to the output.

Implicit Code Expressions
<code>
Plain text @... Plain text
</code>

Explicit Code Expressions
<code>
Plain text @(...) Plain text
</code>

Email Address: the Razor Engine assumes text formatted as "a@b.c" is an email address, and will not implicitly interpret it as a code expression.

#Escape

Escape "@" (at sign) with another "@".
<code>
@@Plain text
</code>

Explicitly specify string literals:
<code>
@:Plain text
</code>
