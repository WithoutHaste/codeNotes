##Terminology

#ACID

The ACID properties are rules for how a database management service will function to ensure that the database remains consistent, before and after each transaction.

Atomicity: Either the entire transaction succeeds, or none of it does. If anything in the transaction fails, everything already done will be rolled back. Also called "all or nothing".

Consistency: All data integrity constraints are followed, as of the end of each transaction.

Isolation: Multiple transactions can occur concurrently without messing each other up.

Durability: Once a transaction has been committed, that data will not be lost, even in the event of system failure.

#Command Categories

DDL stands for Data Definition Language. These commands deal with the structure of the database.
DDL includes CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE, COMMENT, and RENAME.

DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. These commands deal with the manipulation of data.
DML includes SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

DCL stands for Data Control Language. These commands deal with database security.
DCL includes GRANT and REVOKE.

TCL stands for Transaction Control Language. These commands deal with managing transactions.
TCL includes COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT, and SET TRANSACTION.

#Referential Integrity

Maintaining the Foreign Key to Primary Key constraints.
Every Foreign Key must have a matching Primary Key in the referenced table.

#Transaction

A transaction is a collection of statements that will be run together. Either all of them will succeed, or all of them will fail together.

#T-SQL

T-SQL stands for Transaction SQL. It's a Microsoft language that extends basic SQL.

#Misc

"Row version" is a synonym for "timestamp" in SQL Server. So you might see "row version" in an error message when it means the timestamp column.
