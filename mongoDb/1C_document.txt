##Document

A document contains multiple Key/Value Pairs called Fields.

A document is analogous to a SQL Row/Record.

#JSON

Documents are displayed, edited, etc as JSON objects.

Ex:
<code lang='javascript'>
{
	_id: ObjectId(7df78ad8902c),
	title: 'Test',
	comments: [
		{
			user: 'Steve',
			comment: 'Test comment'
		}
	]
}
</code>

#Default Key

MongoDb provides a default key Field called "_id".
You can specify the _id when inserting a record, or allow MongoDb to generate it.
The default _id is made up of the timestamp, machine id, process id, and sequence number.
