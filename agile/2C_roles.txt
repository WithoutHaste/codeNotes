##Roles

Agile teams are made up of people from many different departments. They should consider themselves part of the team first, and members of different departments second.

Team members do what is needed at the time it is needed to achieve the team goals.

#Product Expert

The product export or domain expert will interact closely with users/customers.
They will research the market the product is in, and what business benefits the software will provide.

They create and prioritize work for the team.
They help determine when work is complete.

Scrum calls this role the "Product Owner".

#Cross-Functional Skills

Some team members have cross-functional skills for building and operating the entire system, and understanding how it will fit into the larger world.

These core members work as a single team to design, code, test, and implement a software system.

They must all work and collaborate together.
A team member will frequently assume multiple roles in additional to their primary responsibilities.

#Leadership

This may be the manager or the team lead. Their goal is to enable and support the success of the team.
This may involve managing stakeholder expectations, company communication, progress reporting, motivating team members, budget management, and staff management.

This is a "servant leadership" role, where the leader's main focus is serving the team.

Scrum calls this role the "Scrum Master".

#Coach

It is helpful for have someone available as coach/mentor.

This person is not responsible for any specific project deliverables. They focus on continuous improvement and engineering discipline.
They help guide the team to become better every single day.
