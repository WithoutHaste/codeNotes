##Basics

Ruby: a programming language

Rails: a Ruby framework used for web development
"Ruby on Rails"

Gems: Ruby add-ons (called libraries or packages in other languages) you can include in your project
specify what you need in file "gemfile"

Bundlers: helps you manage Gems and their version dependencies
writes file "gemfile.lock" which specifies exact versions

Ruby files use *.rb extension

Ruby is object-oriented and can also be used for functional programming

can do Desktop and Web apps

#Comments

single line comments
hash aka sharp aka pound (#) is used to comment out a line
<code>
 # single line comment
 puts 'hi' # more comments
</code>

block comments aka multiline comments
<code>
=begin
comment line
comment line
=end

=begin
escape character `=being
=end
</code>

#End Of Line

a statement can be ended with a semicolon (;) or end-line

if a line ends with an operator (+ - \, for example) then the statement will be continued onto the next line

#Hello World

file: hello_world.rb
<code>
puts 'Hello world'
</code>

run in terminal
<code>
ruby hello_world.rb
</code>

#Naming Conventions

Identifiers are names of variables, constants, methods
Identifiers are case sensitive

Class names use camel case: MyClass

Variable names use snake case: my_variable_name, my_variable_name_2
Method names use snake case: my_method_name, my_method_name_2

local variable names start with a lowercase letter or _

#Init New Project

in project dir
<code>
//in terminal
gem install bundler
touch gemfile
</code>

edit "gemfile" to say
<code>
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'pry'
</code>
(pry is useful for debugging)

run the bundler
<code>
//in terminal
bundle install
</code>
- installs the gems and their dependencies
- creates gemfile.lock
