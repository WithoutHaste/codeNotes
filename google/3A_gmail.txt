#Labels

GMail doesn't have "folders", it has "labels".

You can drag-and-drop a message to a Label, but it's really intended to drag-and-drop Labels onto Messages.
Like a sticky note.
You can apply more than one to each Message.

Labels you've chosen to hide/make inactive are visible under "More" in the left-hand menu.

Left-hand menu > "Manage Labels" and "Create New Label" to create/edit labels.

Labels can be nested under each other.
- the label appears with the full path to the label

Labels all show up in the left-hand menu.
- click ... icon to set the color

What labels to make?
- Make labels based on the next action needed on messages, such as "Follow Up", "Reply With Deliverable", "Request Signature"
- Make labels based on deadlines, such as "Due Today", "Due End Of Month"
Now when you click on those labels, you'll see all Messages marked with that label.

#Important Tab

Little gold blocky-left-arrow.
Future messages from the same sender will be auto-marked Important.
