#Preamble

The preamble is everything above the first Section Header.

Setting "root=true" means don't search in parent directories for more .editorconfig. This is the root.
<code lang="ini">
	# http://editorconfig.org
	root = true
</code>

#Comments

Comments are lines starting with ; or #
Only full-line comments are allowed

#Section Header

Section headers are enclosed in [ ]
- uses / as path separator on all operating systems

#Section Name

Section name is the text between the [ ]

Section names are filepath Globs and support pattern matching
- * for any string of characters, except for path separators
- ** for any string of characters
- ? for any single character
- [abc] for any single character in the defined group
- [!abc] for any single character not in the defined group
- {s1,s2,s3} for any string defined in the set
- {num1..num2} for any integer defined in the range (negatives are allowed)
- \ to escape a special character
- Section names have a max length of 4096
- Non-existing directories will not cause an error

Ex:
[*] will apply to all files in the project
[*.md] will apply to all Markdown files in the project
[*.{cs,vb}] will apply to all CS and all VB files in the project

#Section

A section is all the lines from one section header to the next, or to the end of file.

#Key-Value Pair

Key-Value pair looks like Key=Value or Key = Value
- strings are not enclosed in "quotes"

Any key-value pair can be disregarded with an unset command
<code lang="ini">
 # set a value
 insert_final_newline = true
 
 # ignore that value
 insert_final_newline = unset
</code>

#Example

<code lang="ini">
 # http://editorconfig.org
 root = true
 
 # Global settings
 [*]
 max_line_length = 0
 charset = utf-8
 indent_size = 2
 indent_style = space
 insert_final_newline = true
 trim_trailing_whitespace = true
 
 # Markdown
 [*.md]
 trim_trailing_whitespace = false
 
 # Dotnet code style settings
 [*.{cs,vb}]
 indent_size = 4
 indent_style = tab
 
 # Sort using and Import directives with System.* appearing first
 dotnet_sort_system_directives_first = true
 
 # Avoid "this." and "Me." if not necessary
 dotnet_style_qualification_for_field = false:error
 dotnet_style_qualification_for_property = false:error
 dotnet_style_qualification_for_method = false:error
