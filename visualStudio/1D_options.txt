#Code Style

VS can provide suggestions for refactoring based on a set of coding style standards.

There are defaults in the Options dialog.
The defaults will be overridden by the .editorconfig file in the root directory of the project.

Ex:
<code lang="ini">
# Prefer method-like constructs to have an expression body
csharp_style_expression_bodied_methods = true:error
csharp_style_expression_bodied_constructors = true:error
csharp_style_expression_bodied_operators = true:error
</code>
This will underline block bodies in red (because "error") with the suggestion to refactor them to expression bodies.
