##Don Box's 4 Tenets of SOA

#Boundaries are explicit

Services interact by sending messages across boundaries. The boundaries are formal and explicit. No assumption is made about what is behind the boundary.

Ex: the client does not know what kind of database or file system the service is using.

#Services are autonomous

A service does not care how a message was created, or what will happen in the client after the service performs its actions.

Therefore, version and deploy the service independently from the client.

Therefore, design service contracts assuming that once published, they cannot change.

#Services share schema and contract, not class

Only message pass between services, not code. The messages are not random; they have been agreed upon.

#Service compatibility is based upon policy

A service must express what it does and how a client should communicate with it in a standard representation.
