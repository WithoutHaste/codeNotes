##Files

#Write

The write command does not automatically add an end-line character.

Create or overwrite file
<code>
f = open("filename.txt", "w") #w for write
f.write("text")
f.close()
</code>

Append to file
<code>
f = open("filename.txt", "a") #a for append
f.write("more text")
f.close()
</code>

#Read

Read - read the entire file as one string
<code>
f = open("filename.txt", "r") #r for read
text = f.read() #read will read in the entire file at once as a string
f.close()
</code>

Read(charCount) - read a few characters at a time
<code>
f = open("filename.txt", "r") #r for read
charCount = 1
next = f.read(charCount) #read a few chars at a time
while next != "":
	next = f.read(charCount)
f.close()
</code>

Readline - read one line at a time
The line still has the end-line character
<code>
f = open("filename.txt", "r") #r for read
next = f.readline() #reads one line (to \n char)
while next != "":
	next = f.readline()
f.close()
</code>

Readlines - read in all lines at once, as a list of strings
Each line still has the end-line character
<code>
f = open("filename.txt", "r") #r for read
text = f.readlines()
f.close()
</code>

#Byte Position

Tell - returns the current byte position of the cursor in the file
<code>
currentBytePosition = file.tell()
</code>

Seek(position) - move to an absolute byte position in the file
<code>
file.seek(absoluteBytePosition)
file.seek(absoluteBytePosition, 0)
</code>

Seek(position, 1) - move forward the specified number of bytes
<code>
file.seek(relativeBytePosition, 1)
</code>

Seek(position, 2) - move to the specified byte position, counting backward from the end of the file
<code>
file.seek(fromEndOfFile, 2)
</code>
