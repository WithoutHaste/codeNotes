## Include

Include text of another file in this one, to use functions/etc.

Note that relative paths are relative to the place you run "php" from.

<code>
include("filename.php");
include("../filename.php");
include("/absolute/system/path/filename.php");
</code>

Includes are transitive, meaning that if A.php includes B.php, and B.php includes C.php, then elements of C can be used by A.
