##Package

A package can be any of the following:
(a) a folder containing "package.json" and a program
(b) a gzipped tarball containing (a)
(c) a url that resolves to (b)
(d) a name@version published on the registry with (c)
(e) a name@tag that points to (d)
(f) a name that has a "latest" tag satisfying (e)
(g) a git url that resolves to (a)

#package.json

"package.json" must contain at least:
<code lang="json">
{
	"name": "package name",
	"version": "1.0.0"
}
</code>
@name/version forms a unique id for your package.
name cannot be longer than 214 characters (including scope).
name cannot start with a period (.) or underscore (_).
name must be all lowercase.
name should use hyphens (-) to delimit words. Ex: more-than-one-word.
name must be url-safe, as it will become a file name, a folder name, and a url.
name should not include "node" or "js" as this is assumed.
version must be parseable by node-semver.
	Good examples:
		1.2.3
		v1.2.3
		1.2.3-alpha
	Bad examples:
		a.b.c

Any dependencies must also be defined in "package.json".
<code lang="json">
{
	"name": "package name",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"dependencies": {
		"@other-package-name/build-scripts": "^1.0.443",
		"@pie/components": "1.0.849"
	}
}
</code>

##package-lock.json

"package-lock.json" is an optional file in the same directory as "package.json".

This file will be automatically generated if npm modifies the node_modules tree or your "package.json".
This file ensures that everyone's dependency trees remain synced, regardless of intermediate changes.

This file is not published, and will be ignored anywhere except in the package root directory.

##shrinkwrap.json

Same format and purpose as "package-lock.json", but can be published.

Takes precedence over "package-lock.json" if both are present.
