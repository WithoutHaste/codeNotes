#Command Prompt

To change your default directory (in Windows 10, as of Dec 2019)
- Go to: C:\Users\<name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Windows System
- Right-click Command Prompt > Properties
- Shortcut tab > change "Start in" to any bash path

If you have pinned Command Prompt to your taskbar, you'll need to remove it and then re-pin it to see the change.

AppData is a hidden folder.
