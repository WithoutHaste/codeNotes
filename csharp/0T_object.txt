##It's All Objects

Everything in C# is derived from the Object class.

ValueType is derived from Object.
All value types are derived from ValueType. These types are treated as true value types from other languages (for example, memory is allocated to the stack).
You cannot explicitly derive from ValueType. All structs are derived from ValueType.
Ex: Int32 is a struct derived from ValueType.
