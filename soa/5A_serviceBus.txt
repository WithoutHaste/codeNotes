##Enterprise Service Bus

ESB stands for Enterprise Service Bus.

A service bus implements a communication system between mutually interacting software.

Instead of N services each communicating with (N-1) services, all services communicate with the service bus only, resulting in only N lines of communication.  The service bus passes messages through to the target service.
