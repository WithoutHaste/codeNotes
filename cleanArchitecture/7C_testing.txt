##Testing

Mathematical theorems can be proven correct.

Scientific theories can be proven wrong, but not correct, so that's a fundamental difference. Scientific theories are falsifiable.

Dijkstra:
Testing shows the presence, not the absence, of bugs.

A program, like a scientific theory, can be proven incorrect with a test, but can never be proven 100% correct. We show correctness by failing to prove incorrectness, despite our best efforts.
