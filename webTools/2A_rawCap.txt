RawCap can log localhost traffic in Windows 10.
Logs are saved in PCAP format, which can be viewed in WireShark.

No installation, just run the exe in command prompt.
Ex: RawCap.exe 127.0.0.1 log.pcap
- use "127.0.0.1" rather than "localhost"
- Ctrl+C in the RawCap window to save logs and close the program

RawCap will not capture SOAP traffic (at least not in a useful way) - try Fiddler instead.
