#.csdef

*.csdef is your Cloud Service Definition file.
Naming convention: ServiceDefinition.csdef.

It is an XML file.
It defines the service model and the number of roles.

The definition cannot be altered after you upload it.

Each ServiceDefinition must contain 1 to 25 roles (WebRole or WorkerRole).

Example:
<code lang="xml">
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<ServiceDefinition name="MyServiceName" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ServiceHosting/2008/10/ServiceDefinition">
	  <WebRole name="WebRole1" vmsize="Medium">
		<Sites>
		  <Site name="Web">
			<Bindings>
			  <Binding name="HttpIn" endpointName="HttpIn" />
			</Bindings>
		  </Site>
		</Sites>
		<Endpoints>
		  <InputEndpoint name="HttpIn" protocol="http" port="80" />
		  <InternalEndpoint name="InternalHttpIn" protocol="http" />
		</Endpoints>
		<Certificates>
		  <Certificate name="Certificate1" storeLocation="LocalMachine" storeName="My" />
		</Certificates>
		<Imports>
		  <Import moduleName="Connect" />
		  <Import moduleName="Diagnostics" />
		  <Import moduleName="RemoteAccess" />
		  <Import moduleName="RemoteForwarder" />
		</Imports>
		<LocalResources>
		  <LocalStorage name="localStoreOne" sizeInMB="10" />
		  <LocalStorage name="localStoreTwo" sizeInMB="10" cleanOnRoleRecycle="false" />
		</LocalResources>
		<Startup>
		  <Task commandLine="Startup.cmd" executionContext="limited" taskType="simple" />
		</Startup>
	  </WebRole>

	  <WorkerRole name="WorkerRole1">
		<ConfigurationSettings>
		  <Setting name="DiagnosticsConnectionString" />
		</ConfigurationSettings>
		<Imports>
		  <Import moduleName="RemoteAccess" />
		  <Import moduleName="RemoteForwarder" />
		</Imports>
		<Endpoints>
		  <InputEndpoint name="Endpoint1" protocol="tcp" port="10000" />
		  <InternalEndpoint name="Endpoint2" protocol="tcp" />
		</Endpoints>
	  </WorkerRole>
	</ServiceDefinition>
</code>

Sites: websites or web applications hosted in IIS7

InputEndpoints: endpoints for contacting this service

InternapEndpoints: endpoints used by this service's role instances to communicate with each other

ConfigurationSettings: settings for a specific role

Certificates: certificates needed to a role

LocalResources: a local directory in which a role is running

Imports: imported modules

Startup: tasks to run when a role starts

#.cscfg

*.cscfg is your Cloud Service Configuration file.
Naming convention: ServiceConfig.cscfg.

It is an XML file.
It provides settings to the service, individual roles, and the number of role instances.

The configuration can be altered after you upload it.

#.cspkg

*.cspkg is your Service Package.

It is a zip file.
It contains the application code and model.
The model is made up of the *.csdef and *.cscfg files.

#Quick Create

Create a new cloud service

Upload (deploy) a cloud service package

#Custom Create

If you already have your service ready to upload, you can do all the Quick Create steps at once here.

#From Visual Studio

1) Create a web service
2) In Visual Studio > right-click on project > Publish Web App (VS 2017) or Publish (VS 2015)
3) Select target Microsoft Azure App Service
4) (if not already) log into Microsoft Azure
5) Select an existing Web App (or create a new one)
6) Check the publish form is filled out correctly > Publish
7) Watch of the Success message in the output panel

- Did not work from 2015 Community - got error about "No registered provider found" for App version 2.0.
- Works fine from 2017 Community.

8) In Azure > select the App Service you just published to > Deployment Center tab
9) Select a deployment option (Instructions continue for Manual Deploy From FTP) > click Dashboard
10) for User Credentials, the username format is "appName\userName"
- enter User Credentials
11) In Visual Studio > right-click on project > Publish

Possible error: the publish succeeded but navigating to the page shows message "Your app service is up and running. Time to take the next step and deploy your code."
- One recommendation was to go to Azure Portal > your App Service > Configuration > Default Documents > and make sure your default page in the list, above "hostingstart.html".  This did not work for me. But saving changes to Default Document caused the service to restart and it started working.
- Another said "In my case the app was failing to start up due to an unhandled exception thrown in my startup code."

#Connection Strings

Azure Portal > your App Service > Configuration > Connection Strings

These connection strings will override the ones in your Web.config, based on the connection string name.

You can verify the connection string in the code with
<code>
using System.Configuration; //include reference in project

return ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["ConnectionStringName"].ConnectionString;
</code>

You'll need to give this service access through the database's firewall.
- Get you App Service IP Address as Azure Portal > your App Service > Properties > Virutal IP Address
- go to Azure Portal > SQL Server (not the database resource) > Security > Firewalls And Virtual Networks
- add a firewall rule for the App Service IP Address > Save Changes
It may take a few minutes for this change to take affect.
