#User Story Size

Regarding user stories / tickets / whatever you call a task in Jira/TFS/etc.

How large should a user story be? Meaning how much work should be encompassed by a single user story?

I recommend small user stories. Break larger tasks down into smaller, cohesive pieces.
Ex: You're refactoring, and it will affect several endpoints of your service. If possible, refactor one endpoint at a time.
Ex: You're adding a create-and-edit feature. Do the creation work first, then the edit work.

Rules of thumb for how to break down a large task:
- Separate by function, such as create-edit-delete.
- Separate by code base, such as updating a service, then updating the front-end.
- Separate by layer, such as adding new objects, then adding the operations that use them.
- Separate by slice, such as updating one endpoint at a time.
- Separate by work mode, such as research, then design, then implementation.

Benefits of small user stories:
- You had to think through the task already, in order to break the task into smaller pieces.
- Small tasks are easier to hold in your head. You'll forget and overlook less.
- Small tasks are easier for other developers to validate. A small pull request is easier to sign-off on with confidence.
- Small tasks are less likely to balloon out of control with unforeseen requirements or implementation problems.
- Doing a small part of the task first is a good way to establish the pattern that will be followed for the rest.
- You're mind will be clearer when you can steadily complete small tasks.
- You're mood will be better when you can steadily complete small tasks.
