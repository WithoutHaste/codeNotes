##XML Documentation

Type three forward slashes (///) in the line directly above a method or class to initiate a template for documenting that part of your code.

These special comments will provide information for IntelliSense and API documentation.

<code>
/// <summary>
/// Description of the purpose of the method.
/// </summary>
public void MyMethod()
{
}
</code>

These special comments are not included in the compiled assembly and are not available through reflection.

To enable generation of automated documentation files from these comments:
1) Open project properties
2) Go to Build tab
3) Check "XML documentation file"
4) (optional) change the default documentation file location
5) Build the project

#Processors

There are many tools available to convert the XML documentation into a web page or Markdown - Sandcastle and DocFX, for instance.

!![This is my tool.](https://github.com/WithoutHaste/EarlyDocs)
It generates a collection of Markdown documents, one for each Type. It pulls information from the XML documentation and the DLL itself (if available).
