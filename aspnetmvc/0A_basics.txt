##ASP.Net

ASP.Net is a web framework for server-side web applications, producing dynamic web pages.

ASP stands for Active Server Pages. 

ASP.Net is a big improvement on the previous ASP. The main difference to the pages is that ASP pages are interpreted (like PHP) while ASP.Net pages are compiled.

The main assembly for ASP.Net MVC is System.Web.Mvc.
