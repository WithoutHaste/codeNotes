# Extensions

## Getting Started

!![First extension how-to](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension)

## Local Testing

Navigate to "about::debugging" in the browser.

Click "Load Temporary Add-On".

Select any file in the extension's directory.
- the extension will stay until you restart the browser

You may also need to:
- Tools > Options > Extensions & Themes > Extensions > select this test extension ... Manage > Details > Allow to Run in Private Windows

## Options

To open the settings/options page for an extension:
- Tools > Options > Extensions & Themes > Extensions > select this test extension ... Options

The options page cannot write to the console (at least, my tests of that aren't working).

This page is hard to debug because errors aren't reported in the console.
