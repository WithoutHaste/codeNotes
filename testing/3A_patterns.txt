# Patterns

## Differentiation

(I don't know if there is an industry term for this.)

When filling in mock or dummy data, make each field value as distinct from the others as possible. For example, set all integer values to different integers.

Benefits:
- easier for a human to visually scan the data
- more likely to reveal errors such as mapping the wrong field
