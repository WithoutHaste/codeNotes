##Basics

!![From Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/tutorials/how-to-do-scrum-with-jira-software)

You can create Projects with the Scrum or Kanban template.
A new Project has an empty Backlog (aka product backlog).

The Backlog is a list of potential work items.
Jira calls all work items, user stories, tasks, and bugs the same thing: Issues.

User Stories use non-technical descriptions and are written from the user's perspective.
Ex: As a _Customer Care rep_, I want _clients to be able to set themselves up for ACH payments using any bank_ so that I _spend less time doing this manually_.

The development team will add detailed, technical Tasks (aka subtasks) under the User Story to show how to achieve the goal.
The development team will assign Story Points to the User Story, indicating the estimated amount of time/effort required to complete it.

In the Backlog, Issues can be drag-n-dropped to reorder them, which indicates their priority.

Create a Sprint from the Backlog page (maximum 1 sprint per backlog).
A Sprint is a fixed time duration during which the development team commits to completing a selection of Issues.
Issues assigned to a Sprint make up the Sprint Backlog.
You can name each Sprint.
Your Active Sprint is the current sprint. In next-gen Scrum, this is called the Board.

The product owner may set a Sprint Goal - a theme for the work to be completed. The Sprint is a success if the Sprint Goal is achieved.
Ex: Improve automation.

Once the sprint is finished, click Complete Sprint on the sprint page.
Incomplete issues can be moved to the backlog or to a future sprint.

The Burn Down Chart (under Reports) shows the estimated amount of work assigned to the sprint, a guideline for how much should be completed each day (veeeeeeery rough), and a line of how much has actually been moved to Done each day.
Warnings signs of various problems:
- The team finishes early sprint after sprint because they aren't committing to enough work.
- The team misses their forecast sprint after sprint because they're committing to too much work.
- The burndown line makes steep drops rather than a more gradual burndown because the work hasn't been broken down into granular pieces.
- The product owner adds or changes the scope mid-sprint.

The Sprint Report (under Reports) shows a summary of the sprint: including the burn down chart, completed issues, not-completed issues, and the backlog that isn't on the sprint.
