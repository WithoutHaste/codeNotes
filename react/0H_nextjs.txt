##Next.js

Next.js is a toolchain
it is a React server-side framework
it connects the React library (a javascript library) to what is needed for debugging and publishing an app
these toolchains are not required but are a huge time saver

Next.js is not based on Node.js, Next.js runs on top of Node.js

the root component of a Next.js app will be in App.js

How to use:
- install Node.js
- run "npx create-next-app@latest" to get a basic app initialized
  - if you answer "No" to using the App Router, then you will be using Page Router in your App instead

if you use App Router, then all your components will be server components (rendered on the server) and will therefore not be able to manage state in the client's browser
