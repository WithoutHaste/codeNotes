#Search

You can search all repos in one organization at a time.
- go to the organization's page, such as "github.com/Org"
- type into the "search or jump to" prompt
- the default search "org:Org" will auto fill

Search for text in files
<code>
org:Org mytext
</code>
You cannot search for these characters . , : ; / \ ` ' " = * ! ? # $ & + ^ | ~ < > ( ) { } [ ] @

Search by file extension
<code>
org:Org extension:csproj
org:Org extension:csproj mytext
</code>

I haven't found a sort option by repo, so the results can be really mixed up.
