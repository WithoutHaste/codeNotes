##Labels

Label a block of code:
<code>
 <<myLabel>>
 BEGIN
	//statements
 END;
</code>

An exit command can be labeled to tell which block to exit. Exit command must be nested within that block.
<code>
 <<myLabel>>
 BEGIN
	LOOP
		IF x > 10 THEN
			EXIT myLabel; //execution of loop ends here
		END IF;
	END LOOP;
 END;
 //execution picks up outside "myLabel" block
</code>

A continue command can be labeled to tell which loop to continue the next iteration of. Continue command must be nested within that loop.
<code>
 <<labelA>>
 LOOP
	//execution picks up on next iteration of "labelA" loop 
	<<labelB>>
	LOOP
		IF x > 10 THEN
			CONTINUE labelA; //execution of loop ends here
		END IF;
	END LOOP;
 END LOOP;
</code>
