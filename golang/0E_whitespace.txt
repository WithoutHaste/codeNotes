## Spacing

Go is formatted with tabs and line breaks.

The tabs are not required, but they are highly recommended.

The line breaks are required if you don't end your lines with semicolons.
The compiler does automatically add the endline semicolons.
The recommended style seems to be to not write the semicolons yourself.

The javascript-like curly braces is required.
<code>
func abc() {
}
</code>
