##Message Exchange Patterns (MEPs)

These are the patterns of communication available between client and service.

#Request/Reply

A channel is established between client and service. The client sends one request, the service sends one reply, and the channel is closed.

#One Way

A channel is established between client and service. The client sends one request, and the channel is closed. The client does not expect any reply or faults to be returned.

#Duplex

A channel is established between the client and service. This channel is used for multiple request/reply cycles before it is closed.
