##User-Defined Function

You can use the result of a table-valued function as a normal table in a JOIN clause.

You can use a scalar-valued function in a SELECT clause, WHERE clause, or HAVING clause. Be careful of performance issues, since the UDF will be called on every row in the result set.

#Naming Convention

"fn_FunctionName"

#Table-Valued Function

A function that returns a table-type value.

Single-statement TVF
<code>
CREATE FUNCTION fn_functionName (
	@paramA dataType
) RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN
	SELECT
		*
	FROM tableName
	WHERE columnA = @paramA
</code>

Multi-statement TVF
<code>
CREATE FUNCTION fn_functionName (
	@paramA dataType
)
RETURNS @resultTable TABLE 
(
	Id BIGINT,
	Name VARCHAR(32)
)
AS
BEGIN
	-- Fill the table variable with the rows for your result set
	
	RETURN 
END
GO
</code>

I don't think you can use temp tables in a TVF. I think you can only "INSERT INTO" the result table.
But you CAN use Table Variables.
<code>
DECLARE @TableVariable TABLE (Id INT, Name VARCHAR(255), ParentId INT, ParentName VARCHAR(255));
INSERT INTO @TableVariable...
</code>

#Scalar-Valued Function

A function that returns a scalar-value, such as an int or varchar.

<code>
CREATE FUNCTION fn_functionName (
	@paramA dataType
) RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
	DECLARE @count INT;
	SELECT
		@count = COUNT(*)
	FROM tableName
	WHERE columnA = @paramA;
	RETURN(@count);
END;
</code>

#SP vs UDF

Stored Procedures vs User-Defined Functions

A stored procedure is a collection of any statements. A user-defined function is much more limited.
Generally, stored procedures are used to complete a specific task, and user-defined functions are used to make generic computations.

SP can return 0 to N values.
UDF must return 1 value.

SP support input and output parameters.
UDF only supports input parameters.

SP can contain any DML statement (CRUD operations).
UDF only supports SELECT statements. UDF can't even use TRY/CATCH. UDF can't use transaction commands.

SP can call a UDF.
UDF cannot call an SP.

SP cannot be called within a SELECT statement, WHERE clause, or HAVING clause.
UDF can be called within a SELECT statement, WHERE clause, and HAVING clause. UDF that returns a table can be treated as a normal table within a query.

SP are stored in compiled form, so they will run quickly.
UDF are interpreted each time they run.
