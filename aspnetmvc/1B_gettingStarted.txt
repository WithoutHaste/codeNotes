##Getting Started

#Setup

Setting up a basic environment to create and run an ASP.Net site with a database backend.

Install:
1) Visual Studio: for writing and testing code
2) SQL Server: database
3) IIS Express: local web server to run application

#Run

Start Coding:
1) Open Visual Studio (these instructions written for VS Community 2015)
2) Click New Project > C# > Web > ASP.Net Web Application > MVC Template
 - Check "Add Unit Tests" (use default name MyAppName.Tests)
 - Leave "Authentication" on "Individual User Accounts"
 - Uncheck Azure "Host in the Cloud"
3) Click "Ok" and wait for template to generate
4) Click "Play"
 - IIS Express will be started automatically to run the application
 - The default landing page will open in the browser
 
The IIS Express icon will be visible on the right-side of the task bar, looking like a stack of blue boxes. Right-click on it to get to a list of all running applications.
Requests from the browser come to IIS Express, which sends them to the ASP.Net Routing Engine.
 
#HTML Basics

With MVC 4 and later, the rendered web pages will all include basic HTML5 best-practices.

<code lang="xml">
  <!DOCTYPE html> <!-- HTML 5 -->
  <html lang="en"> <!-- spoken language -->
    <head>
	  <meta charset="utf-8" /> <!-- for cross-browser compatibility -->
	  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" /> <!-- for mobile device compatibility -->
      <script src="/Scripts/modernizr-2.6.2.js"></script> <!-- backwards compatibility to pre-HTML5 browsers -->
	</head>
  </html>
</code>
