##Inspector

The inspector pane will show and edit details of the selected asset.

At the very top is the name of the object or asset.

Position, depth, and dimensions are at the top.
Also at the top is an image with a red cross-hair. Click that to set how the asset is anchored to the view. The position and dimensions are relative to the anchor point.

At the bottom is the "Add Component" button.
Add Component > Layout > some selection - can be used to set a lot of default behavior.
