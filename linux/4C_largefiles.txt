## Large Files

Compress large files with tar/zip
<code>
tar -czvf name-of-archive.tar.gz /path/to/directory-or-file
</code>
-c: Create an archive.
-z: Compress the archive with gzip.
-v: Display progress in the terminal while creating the archive, also known as "verbose" mode. Optional.
-f: Allows you to specify the filename of the archive.

Split large files
<code>
split -b 1024m the-big-file
</code>
"1024m" means split them into pieces of size 1024 megabytes (= 1 gigabyte)
this does not specify an output filename, and will result in names "xaa", "xab", "xac", etc
<code>
split -b 1024m output-prefix the-big-file
</code>
this specifies the prefix for the output filenames
