##Macro

In GameMaker, macros are global constant variables.  They can also contain functions.

Name macros with all-caps for legibility.

Values can be a number, a "string" in quotes, or a function call with arguments specified (arguments must all be global as well).

As of Game Maker 2, macros are listed under the Scripts tree and are defined in code.
<code>
	#macro VARIABLE_BEST_TIME "BestTime"
	#macro DEFAULT_BEST_TIME -1
	#macro BEST_TIME_COUNT 5
	#macro MILLISECONDS_PER_SECOND 1000
	#macro MILLISECONDS_PER_MINUTE MILLISECONDS_PER_SECOND * 60
</code>
Note: No equal signs, No semicolons.
