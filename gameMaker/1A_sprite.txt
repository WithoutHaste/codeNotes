##Sprite

A single image, or a sequence of images creating an animation.

Sprites are applied to objects to make them visible.

Prefix sprite names with "spr_" for legibility.

Sprites can be loaded from JPG, BMP, PNG, GIF, SWF vector sprites, and Spine JSON skeletal animation sprites.
It is recommended to use PNG or BMP over JPG due to superior image quality.

Before importing an animation strip, give the suffix "_stripXX", where XX is the number of tiles in the strip.  When imported, this will be automatically broken into XX individual images.
