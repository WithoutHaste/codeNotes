##Comments

Inline comments like so --dash dash to end of line
Multiline comments like so /* slash star to star slash */

##Naming Convention

By default, names of tables/columns/etc can only include underscore (_) and letters.

To use spaces, put [square brackets] around the name.

##Recommendations

#Specify Schema

In stored procedures, views, etc, always specify the schema of each table. Say "dbo.customer" instead of just "customer".
!![Reference](www.sommarskog.se/dynamic_sql.html)

Why? Users can have different default schemas set.  The database will look in the user's default schema first.

1) It will take longer to find the table

2) defaultSchema.tableName might also exist, so the wrong table would be used

3) the query plan will be cached as defaultSchema.tableName, so each user could end up caching a separate query plan - very inefficient

#Caching

General considerations:

Query plan caching is whitespace-sensitive and case-sensitive.

Custom queries (dynamic SQL) are cached using the hash of the query text.  Using a lot of these can really degrade performance.

#Parameterize

To improve query plan caching, always parameterize you queries.  That way, the specific values of the parameters don't affect how the query plan is cached.

The speed difference between parameterized and non-parameterized queries can be dramatic.
