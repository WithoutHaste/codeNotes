##Background

Backgrounds are images that you can set as room backgrounds.

Backgrounds can be a single large image, or smaller tiled images.  Tiles are preferred by the engine.  You can use irregular tile sets.

Image formats accepted are PNG, GIF, BMP, and JPG.

Prefix your background names with "bck_" for legibility.

#Transparency

You can set the bottom-left pixel of the image as the transparent color.
