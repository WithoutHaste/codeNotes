##Basics

My preference is to create forms entirely in code, so when I add a new file I select "class" instead of "form" to get a simple *.cs file.

#Setup

Set project icon file through Properties > Application.

Start with a Windows Form application with output type Windows Application.

Add a Setup-type project to the solution.
...configuration details I didn't write down...
1) Property AddRemoveProgramsIcon: set icon like the Shortcut instructions below
2) Property Author: informational
3) Property Manufacturer: program will be installed in this folder - no spaces
4) Property ProductName: 
5) Property Title:
6) Property Version: set to version number

To make the installation also add a desktop-shortcut to your program:
1a) Right-click on the Setup project in Visual Studio
1b) Select View > File System
2a) Select Application Folder folder
2b) Right-click on Primary Output From <your program>
2c) Select Create Shortcut To Primary Output From <your program>
3a) Drag the Shortcut to the User's Desktop folder
4a) Click on the Shortcut to see its Properties
4b) Select the Icon Property > Browse > Browse
4c) Change Files Of Type to .exe
4d) Click on Application Folder > Click on Primary Output From <your program> > Ok
4e) The current icon should be selected already > Click Ok 
5a) Back in the File System window, right-click on the Shortcut > Select Rename
5b) Rename the Shortcut to just the display name of your program
