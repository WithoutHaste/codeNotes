##Storage

block level storage
- for files
- updates just the pieces of storage that have been edited
- ex: your harddrive

instance store volumes
- physical storage attached to the server your EC2 instance is running on
- this data is deleted if you stop your instance (because when it is restated, it will likely be on a different server)
- so it is for ephemeral data

#Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)

attach EBS volumes to your EC2 instance
- this data persists when your EC2 instance stops and restarts
- allows incremental backups (snapshots)
- sized up to 16 Terabytes

an availability zone resource

#Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)

data is stored as objects in buckets
- unlimited storage
- max object size is 5 Terabytes
- can version objects (save previous versions)
- create multiple buckets
- security for who can access objects

tiers
- S3 standard: high durability, data stored in at least three facilities at a time
- S3 static web hosting: for static web pages hosted from an S3 bucket
- S3 infrequent access (S3 Standard-IA): for backups and disaster recovery
- S3 glacier: for long term archives, can lock "vaults" to stop edits

lifecycle policies
- can move data between tiers automatically

optimized for write once, read many

every object automatically has a url

object storage: each object is a complete file, each update will cause the entire object to be saved as a whole

#Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)

a managed Linux file system

multiple EC2 instances can access it at once

automatically scales to give you more storage

a regional resource
