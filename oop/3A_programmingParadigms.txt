##Declarative Programming

A paradigm or style in which the language expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. This is an abstraction, specific implementations of the logic exist within the language.

Ex: SQL
Ex: Regular Expressions
Ex: LINQ

The focus is on WHAT must be accomplished rather than the details of HOW.

These languages also Lack Side-Effects or, in other words, is Referentially Transparent. They also frequently have a clear correspondence to mathematical logic.

##Imperative Programming

Uses statements that change a program's state.

Procedural Programming is a subset of Imperative Programming.
