##Security

Authentication: identify clients that call the service.

Authorization: determine what operations authenticated clients can access.

Clients can identify themselves with:
	- Windows account
	- username and password
	- certificate
	- other?
	
Services can identify themselves to clients with a certificate.

#Security Token Service

A service providing tokens for token-based security.  This is the service component that builds, signs, and issues security tokens according to the WS-Trust and WS-Federation protocols.

Ex: Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)

Most STSs today issue tokens formatted with Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), which is an XML vocabulary.

WCF STS is deprecated as of .Net 4.5, when Windows Identification Foundation was integrated into the .Net Framework.

#Claims Aware Application

In a claims aware application, user identity is represented in code as a set of claims.  An external identity system is configured to give your application that data it needs about the user.

Aka Relying-Party Application (RP) which relies on claims.

#Security Token

A security token is a serialized set of claims, digitally signed by the issuing authority.
