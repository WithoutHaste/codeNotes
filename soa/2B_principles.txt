##Principles of SOA Design

#Standardized Service Contract

Services adhere to an explicit service description.

#Loose Coupling

Services minimize dependence on each other.

#Service Abstraction

Services hide the logic they encapsulate.

#Service Reusability

Divide business logic into several services with the intent of maximizing reuse.

#Service Autonomy

Services have control over the logic they encapsulate.

#Service Statelessness

Services should be stateless.

The client should not be required to know that operation A, B, and C must be called in a specific order, or that operation D must be followed by E.

Such specific ordering should be contained in a single operation.

#Service Discoverability

Services can be discovered, usually in a service registry. Ie, a client can invoke a service regardless of its actual location in the network.

#Service Composability

Services break big problems into little problems.

#Service Interoperability

Services use standards that allow diverse clients to use the service.
